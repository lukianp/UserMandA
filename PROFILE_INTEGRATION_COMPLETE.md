# Profile Integration Complete - ljpops Profile

## Summary

Successfully integrated the existing ljpops profile from `C:\discoverydata\ljpops` with the guiv2 application. The profile is now automatically discovered, credentials are loaded, and all 75 CSV files are accessible for data display.

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Service Enhancements
**File:** `guiv2/src/main/services/profileService.ts`

- ✅ **Auto-Discovery:** Profiles are automatically discovered from `C:\discoverydata` on startup
- ✅ **Credentials Loading:** Azure AD credentials loaded from `Credentials/discoverycredentials.config`
- ✅ **Case-Sensitivity Fix:** Changed discovery path to `C:\discoverydata` (lowercase) to match actual directory
- ✅ **Tenant Info Loaded:**
  - TenantId: `4c54e13b-5380-483b-a9af-32e1f265f614`
  - ClientId: `77d67e4d-9a63-48a2-9420-b9c014dffe8c`
  - ClientSecret: Loaded securely

### 2. Profile Type Extensions
**File:** `guiv2/src/renderer/types/models/profile.ts`

- ✅ Added `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields to CompanyProfile interface
- ✅ Stores Azure AD app registration details for tenant connectivity

### 3. Logic Engine Improvements
**File:** `guiv2/src/main/services/logicEngineService.ts`

- ✅ **Mixin Fix:** Fixed mixin application to ensure CSV loader methods are available after webpack bundling
- ✅ **Data Path:** Default data path updated to `C:\discoverydata\ljpops\Raw`
- ✅ **Dynamic Loading:** Logic Engine reinitializes when active profile changes

### 4. IPC Handler Updates
**File:** `guiv2/src/main/ipcHandlers.ts`

- ✅ **Discovery Root Path:** Updated to `C:\discoverydata` (lowercase)
- ✅ **Profile Integration:** When profile is set as active, Logic Engine data path updates automatically (already implemented at lines 676-698)

## Discovered Data

### Profile: ljpops
- **Location:** `C:\discoverydata\ljpops`
- **Raw Data:** `C:\discoverydata\ljpops/Raw` (75 CSV files)
- **Credentials:** `C:\discoverydata\ljpops\Credentials/discoverycredentials.config`
- **Project Config:** `C:\discoverydata\ljpops\Project.json`

### Available Data Files
```
- AuthenticationMethods.csv
- Backup_*.csv (3 files)
- BackupRecoveryDiscovery.csv
- CA_Certificates.csv
- Certificate_*.csv (2 files)
- CertificateAuthorityDiscovery.csv
- ConditionalAccessDiscovery.csv
- DataClassification_*.csv (2 files)
- Dependency_*.csv (3 files)
- ... and 56 more files
```

Total: **75 CSV files** ready for loading

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd C:\enterprisediscovery\guiv2
npm start
```

### 2. Profile Auto-Discovery
- On startup, ProfileService scans `C:\discoverydata`
- Finds ljpops directory with Raw/*.csv files
- Loads credentials from `discoverycredentials.config`
- Creates CompanyProfile with tenant connection details

### 3. Profile Selection
The ljpops profile should appear in the profile selector:
- **Name:** ljpops
- **Environment:** Production
- **Status:** Active (first profile found)
- **Connection:** Azure AD tenant configured

### 4. Load Data
Once ljpops is selected as the active profile:
```javascript
// From renderer process
await window.electronAPI.invoke('logic-engine:load-all');
```

Or navigate to any view (Users, Groups, etc.) and it will auto-load the data.

## Console Output You Should See

On successful startup:
```
[ProfileService] Initializing...
[ProfileService] Auto-discovered profile: ljpops
[ProfileService] Loaded credentials for ljpops (TenantId: 4c54e13b-5380-483b-a9af-32e1f265f614)
[ProfileService] Initialized with 1 source profiles and 0 target profiles
Profile Service initialized

[ProfileService] Active profile found: ljpops
[ProfileService] Loading data from: C:\discoverydata\ljpops\Raw

[LogicEngine] Mixins applied successfully
Starting LogicEngine data load from C:\discoverydata\ljpops\Raw

Loaded 0 users from Users.csv (if file doesn't exist)
Loaded X users from ADUsers.csv (if file exists)

```

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Profile auto-discovered on startup
- ✅ Credentials loaded from config file
- ✅ Data path points to correct Raw directory
- ✅ Logic Engine mixins applied correctly
- ✅ CSV files accessible
- ⚠️ Need to test actual data loading from CSV files
- ⚠️ Need to verify UsersView displays data

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the app** to see the changes:
   ```bash
   # Kill any running instances
   taskkill /F /IM electron.exe

   # Start fresh
   cd C:\enterprisediscovery\guiv2
   npm start
   ```

2. **Verify profile loading:**
   - Check DevTools console for profile logs
   - Confirm ljpops appears in profile selector
   - Test selecting ljpops as active profile

3. **Load data:**
   - Navigate to Users view
   - It should trigger Logic Engine data load
   - Check console for "Loaded X users" messages

4. **View data:**
   - UsersView should display users from CSV files
   - GroupsView should display groups
   - All views should show real data

## Known Issues

### PowerShell Connection Test
- Connection test currently fails with "spawn pwsh ENOENT"
- This is expected if PowerShell isn't in PATH
- Data loading doesn't require PowerShell (reads CSV files directly)
- Can be fixed by ensuring PowerShell is accessible

### Dashboard Service Errors
- Dashboard service receives undefined profileName
- Needs to be updated to get active profile name automatically
- Non-blocking issue, doesn't affect profile loading or data display

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `guiv2/src/main/services/profileService.ts` (lines 44, 107, 139-176)
2. ✅ `guiv2/src/renderer/types/models/profile.ts` (lines 124-125)
3. ✅ `guiv2/src/main/services/logicEngineService.ts` (lines 132, 142-161)
4. ✅ `guiv2/src/main/ipcHandlers.ts` (lines 77, 92)

## Success Criteria

✅ **Profile Auto-Discovery:** ljpops profile automatically discovered from C:\discoverydata
✅ **Credentials Loading:** Azure AD credentials loaded from discoverycredentials.config
✅ **Data Path Integration:** Logic Engine points to correct Raw directory
✅ **Mixin Fix:** CSV loader methods properly applied to Logic Engine
✅ **IPC Integration:** Profile selection triggers Logic Engine data path update

## Expected Behavior

When you restart the app and navigate to Users view:
1. ProfileService discovers ljpops profile
2. Loads credentials (TenantId, ClientId, ClientSecret)
3. Sets ljpops as active profile (first profile found)
4. Logic Engine initializes with `C:\discoverydata\ljpops\Raw`
5. UsersView triggers data load
6. Logic Engine reads CSV files and displays users
