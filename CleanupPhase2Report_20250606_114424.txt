RATIONALE:
Core production files are essential for the M&A Discovery Suite operation:
- MandA-Orchestrator.ps1: Main orchestration engine
- Set-SuiteEnvironment.ps1: Environment setup (referenced by QuickStart)
- DiscoverySuiteModuleCheck.ps1: Module validation (referenced by Orchestrator)
- Validate-*.ps1: Installation and integrity validation scripts
- Setup-AppRegistration*.ps1: Azure app registration setup scripts

Development utility files are helper scripts for development/maintenance:
- Fix-ModuleContext.ps1: Development fix utility
- Unblock-AllFiles.ps1: File unblocking utility
- Add-VersionHeaders.ps1: Version header management
- Apply-LazyInitialization.ps1: Code modification utility
- Diagnose-CredentialFile.ps1: Credential diagnostic utility

FINAL RECOMMENDATION:
The /working directory now contains all testing and development utility files that are
not essential for the core M&A Discovery Suite operation. These files can be excluded
from LLM knowledge import to reduce overhead while preserving them for future reference.
