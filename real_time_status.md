## üéØ IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: Prevent Future Crashes
```
Application is running but unstable due to thread safety violations.
Users should avoid navigating to:
- Group Policies tab
- Applications tab  
- Infrastructure tab
- Groups tab
- Domain Discovery sections
```

### Priority 2: Monitor for Crashes
```
Continuous monitoring active for:
- Process termination detection
- Memory spike detection  
- New thread safety violations
- Performance degradation
```

### Priority 3: Data Refresh
```
All CSV discovery files need immediate refresh:
- Run discovery modules to update data
- Verify data integrity after refresh
- Monitor for data processing errors
```
