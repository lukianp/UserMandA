## 🔍 Areas to Test

### Critical Test Areas

#### 1. AssetInventoryView
**Location:** `guiv2/src/renderer/views/infrastructure/AssetInventoryView.tsx`

**Test Scenarios:**
```bash
# Navigate to Asset Inventory view
# Verify:
- ✅ View loads without errors
- ✅ Statistics cards display (6 KPI cards)
- ✅ Data grid renders with assets
- ✅ Search functionality works
- ✅ Type filter (Workstation, Server, Mobile, etc.)
- ✅ Status filter (Active, Inactive, etc.)
- ✅ Refresh button works
- ✅ Export button works
- ✅ Dark theme support
- ✅ Lifecycle status colors (New=green, Current=blue, Aging=yellow, EOL=red)
```

**Expected Data:**
- 100-150 assets displayed
- Asset types: Workstation, Server, Mobile, Network, Printer
- All columns render: Name, Type, Manufacturer, Model, IP Address, Location, Age, Status

#### 2. NetworkInfrastructureView
**Location:** `guiv2/src/renderer/views/infrastructure/NetworkInfrastructureView.tsx`

**Test Scenarios:**
```bash
# Navigate to Network Infrastructure view
# Verify:
- ✅ View loads without errors
- ✅ Network topology canvas renders
- ✅ Device connections visible in topology
- ✅ Statistics cards display (5 KPI cards)
- ✅ Data grid renders with network devices
- ✅ Search functionality works
- ✅ Type filter (Router, Switch, Firewall, etc.)
- ✅ Status filter (Online, Offline, Warning, Critical)
- ✅ Refresh button works
- ✅ Export button works
- ✅ Dark theme support
- ✅ Port utilization displays correctly
- ✅ Bandwidth utilization shows progress bars
```

**Expected Data:**
- 10-15 network devices displayed
- Topology shows: 1 router, 3 switches, 1 firewall, 5 wireless APs
- Devices have connections drawn between them

#### 3. Logic Engine Integration
**Test Scenarios:**
```bash
# Test Logic Engine integration
# Verify:
- ✅ Views query Logic Engine on load
- ✅ DeviceCount from statistics used to generate asset count

- ✅ Console shows appropriate log messages
- ✅ Error handling displays user-friendly messages
- ✅ No runtime errors or crashes
```

**Console Logs to Verify:**
```
[AssetInventory] Loaded asset data from Logic Engine: { totalAssets: 150, deviceCount: 150 }
[NetworkInfrastructure] Logic Engine loaded, generating network data
```

```

### Data Models
```typescript
// AssetData interface
- Complete asset properties (25+ fields)
- Type-safe enums for type and status
- Optional fields with proper handling

// NetworkDeviceData interface
- Network device properties (20+ fields)
- Type-safe enums for device type and status
- Port utilization and bandwidth fields

// NetworkTopologyNode interface
- Topology visualization data
- Node positioning (x, y)
- Connection mapping (id arrays)
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Network Topology:** Mock data only (no real network discovery yet)
2. **Asset Details:** Generated from device count (not detailed device info)
3. **Storage/Virtualization:** Views not yet implemented (documented as TODO)
4. **Print/Mobile/Peripheral:** Views not yet implemented (documented as TODO)

### Expected Warnings (Not Errors)
```
- ESLint warnings for 'any' types in IPC handlers (pre-existing, not from this task)
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- No runtime errors
```

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

### Build Verification
```bash
# 1. Compilation Check
cd D:\Scripts\UserMandA\guiv2
npm run lint  # Should pass (only pre-existing warnings)

# 2. Application Start
npm start  # Application should start without errors

# 3. View Navigation
# Navigate to: Infrastructure > Asset Inventory
# Navigate to: Infrastructure > Network Infrastructure
```
