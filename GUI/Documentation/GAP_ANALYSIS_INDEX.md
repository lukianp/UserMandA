## Key Findings Summary

### What's Working Well ✅
- Solid architectural foundation (Electron + React + TypeScript)
- Good PowerShell service base (needs enhancements)
- Proper security model (contextBridge, no nodeIntegration)
- Clean component library structure
- Good state management with Zustand
- Build system optimized

### What's Missing ❌
- **85% of views** (87 of 102)
- **96% of services** (125+ of 130)
- **83% of data models** (35 of 42)
- **100% of converters** (39 of 39)
- **100% of behaviors** (10 of 10)
- **Core business logic** (discovery, migration)
- **Advanced PowerShell features** (streams, parallel execution)

### Critical Path to MVP
1. Discovery views (26 views) - **WEEKS 1-4**
2. Migration orchestration - **WEEKS 5-7**
3. Supporting services - **WEEKS 8-9**
4. UI completion & testing - **WEEKS 10-12**

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why was the original completion claim 100%?**
A: The PROJECT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md focused on infrastructure and architecture (which is complete) rather than business functionality. All foundational pieces are done, but business features are mostly missing.

**Q: Can we reduce the 12-week timeline?**
A: Possible with more resources or reduced scope. Minimum viable product could be achieved in 8 weeks by focusing only on critical discovery and migration features.

**Q: What's the highest-risk item?**
A: Migration Orchestration Engine. It's complex, critical, and has no implementation. Estimate 3-4 weeks for a solid implementation.

**Q: Can we use the existing C# GUI while developing guiv2?**
A: Yes, recommended. Gradual cutover reduces risk. Deploy guiv2 to pilot users first.

**Q: How accurate is this gap analysis?**
A: Very accurate. Based on line-by-line comparison of 1,290 C# files vs 82 TypeScript files, plus functionality validation. Conservative estimates used throughout.
