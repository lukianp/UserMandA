## Risk Assessment (Updated)

### Critical Risks

#### 1. Scope Accuracy Risk - MEDIUM (improved from HIGH)
**Status:** Previous analysis underestimated actual progress
**Impact:** Better foundation than thought (40% views, 90% models, 92% components)
**Mitigation:** Realistic assessment completed, accurate backlog created

#### 2. Services Gap Risk - HIGH
**Status:** 96% of services missing (203 of 211)
**Impact:** This is the biggest gap - all backend logic needed
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize top 10 critical services
- Parallel development across service categories
- Code generation for boilerplate

#### 3. Migration Orchestration Risk - CRITICAL
**Status:** 100% missing - no actual migration capability
**Impact:** Cannot perform core business function
**Mitigation:**
- Dedicate Week 1-2 entirely to this
- Senior engineer ownership
- Daily progress reviews

#### 4. PowerShell Integration Risk - MEDIUM
**Status:** 60% complete, missing advanced features
**Impact:** Limited functionality in discoveries
**Mitigation:**
- Week 1 focus on streams + parallel execution
- Comprehensive testing with all modules

#### 5. Timeline Risk - MEDIUM
**Status:** 16 weeks aggressive but achievable
**Impact:** May slip to 20-24 weeks
**Mitigation:**
- Strict prioritization
- Weekly milestone reviews
- Add resources if slipping

### Success Probability

**16-week timeline:** 60% probability
**20-week timeline:** 80% probability
**24-week timeline:** 95% probability

**Recommendation:** Plan for 16 weeks, budget for 20 weeks

   - Acknowledge gaps: Services 4%, Converters 0%, Behaviors 0%

2. **Staff the Team:**
   - Hire 2 senior engineers ASAP
   - Engage QA engineer
   - Target: 4 engineers by Week 1

3. **Establish Governance:**
   - Daily standups
   - Weekly sprint planning
   - Biweekly stakeholder updates

4. **Set Up Infrastructure:**

   - Automated testing
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking (Sentry/similar)

### Week 1 Priorities

**Day 1-2: Migration Orchestration Foundation**
- Create MigrationOrchestrationService.ts
- Implement session management
- State tracking infrastructure

**Day 3-4: PowerShell Enhancements**
- Add multiple stream handling
- Implement parallel execution
- Progress stream parsing

**Day 5: Integration & Testing**
- Wire migration orchestrator to PowerShell
- Create mock migrations for testing
- Integration tests

### Strategic Decisions Needed

**Decision 1: Phased Rollout vs. Big Bang**
- **Recommendation:** Phased rollout
- **Rationale:** Lower risk, faster time-to-value
- **Approach:** Release MVP at Week 4, full features at Week 12

**Decision 2: Maintain C# Version**
- **Recommendation:** Yes, maintain until Week 16
- **Rationale:** Safety net during transition
- **Approach:** Bug fixes only, no new features

**Decision 3: Third-Party vs. Custom Components**
- **Recommendation:** Evaluate for Gantt, Report Builder, Script Editor
- **Rationale:** Complex components, vendor solutions may be faster
- **Examples:** AG Grid (already using), Monaco Editor (script editor), dhtmlxGantt
