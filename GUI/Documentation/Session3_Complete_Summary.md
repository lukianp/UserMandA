## Technical Implementation Details

### Standard Integration Pattern Established

**Proven Pattern (Used by All Views):**

```typescript
// 1. Fetch Logic Engine Statistics
const fetchAnalytics = async () => {
  const result = await window.electronAPI.logicEngine.getStatistics();

  if (result.success && result.data?.statistics) {
    const stats = result.data.statistics;

    // 2. Transform statistics into view-specific data
    const transformedData = transformStats(stats);

    // 3. Update state
    setData(transformedData);
  } else {
    // 4. Fallback to mock data
    setData(getMockData());
  }
};

// 5. Auto-refresh on mount
useEffect(() => {
  fetchAnalytics();
}, []);
```

### IPC Handlers - Production Ready ✅

**Location:** `guiv2/src/main/ipcHandlers.ts:708-861`

**Core Handlers Implemented:**

1. **`logic-engine:load-all`** - Loads all CSV files (Lines 720-769)
2. **`logic-engine:get-user-detail`** - User projections (Lines 771-810)
3. **`logic-engine:get-statistics`** - Entity counts (Lines 812-836) ⭐ Most Used
4. **`logic-engine:invalidate-cache`** - Force reload (Lines 838-861)

**Event Forwarding:**
- `logic-engine:progress` - Load progress updates
- `logic-engine:loaded` - Load completion
- `logic-engine:error` - Error notifications

### Logic Engine Statistics Schema

```typescript
interface LogicEngineStatistics {
  // Entity Counts
  UserCount: number;           // Used by UserAnalyticsView
  GroupCount: number;          // Used by GroupAnalyticsView
  DeviceCount: number;         // Used by AssetInventoryView
  MailboxCount: number;        // Used by ExecutiveDashboardView
  SharePointSiteCount: number;
  OneDriveCount: number;
  ShareCount: number;
  AclCount: number;
  CorrelationCount: number;

  // Performance Metrics
  lastLoadTime: Date;          // Used by PerformanceMetricsView
  isLoading: boolean;
}
```

## Mock Data Strategy

### Analytics Views
**Status:** Minimal mock data - mostly calculated from real counts

**Real Data:**
- ✅ All entity counts (users, groups, devices, mailboxes, etc.)
- ✅ Correlation statistics
- ✅ Performance metrics

**Mock Data (Future Enhancements):**
- ⏳ Department distribution (requires CSV field parsing)
- ⏳ Activity heatmaps (requires audit log tracking)
- ⏳ Historical trends (requires time-series storage)

### Infrastructure Views
**Status:** More extensive mock data - awaiting detailed discovery

**Real Data:**
- ✅ Total device count

**Mock Data (Requires New Discovery Modules):**
- ⏳ Device specifications (CPU, RAM, Disk)
- ⏳ Network configuration (IP, MAC addresses)
- ⏳ Hardware details (Manufacturer, Model, Serial)
- ⏳ Network infrastructure (Routers, Switches, Firewalls)
- ⏳ Network topology and connections

- Focus can shift to remaining 13 infrastructure views or other categories

### 2. IPC Handlers Fully Functional ✅

**Status:**
- All Logic Engine handlers implemented and tested
- Error handling comprehensive
- Event forwarding configured
- Type safety enforced

**Implication:**
- Solid foundation for all future views
- No IPC infrastructure changes needed

### 3. Consistent Integration Pattern ✅

**Achievement:**
- All 23 views follow identical integration pattern
- Predictable data flow
- Uniform error handling
- Consistent mock data fallback

**Implication:**
- Rapid development of remaining views possible
- Pattern can be documented as template
- Onboarding new developers easier

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Mock vs. Real Data Boundary
**Issue:** Distinguishing what's real data vs. mock data
**Solution:**
- Clear TODO comments in code
- Documentation explicitly marks mock sections
- Inline comments explain why mock data is used

### Challenge 2: Infrastructure Requires More Mock Data
**Issue:** Infrastructure views need detailed attributes not in current data
**Solution:**
- Generate realistic mock data based on real counts
- Document future PowerShell module requirements
- Plan for gradual real data integration

### Challenge 3: Historical Trend Data Not Available
**Issue:** Trend analysis requires time-series data not currently tracked
**Solution:**
- Generate trends algorithmically from current values
- Document need for audit log/time-series storage
- Plan future enhancement for real historical tracking

2. **Time-Series Data Storage** (for real trends)
   - Daily snapshots of entity counts
   - Historical data retention policy
   - Trend calculation service
   - Performance history tracking

3. **Enhanced CSV Parsing** (for department data)
   - Custom field extraction
   - Organizational hierarchy parsing
   - Cost center mapping
   - Location data extraction

### Medium Priority

4. **Enhanced Device Discovery Modules**
   - Hardware specification collection
   - Network configuration discovery
   - Software inventory
   - Asset lifecycle tracking

5. **Network Infrastructure Discovery**
   - SNMP device scanning
   - Topology mapping
   - Port/bandwidth monitoring
   - Network health tracking

6. **O365 API Integration** (for license data)
