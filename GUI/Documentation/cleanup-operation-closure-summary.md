2. **Complete Discovery Module Inventory** - All CSV data sources cataloged and categorized
3. **Empty State Implementation Guide** - Code patterns and best practices
4. **Maintenance Procedures** - Long-term system care instructions

## What Was Preserved During Cleanup

### Data Preservation Actions
- **Company Profiles**: All credential files and configuration data maintained
- **Current Discovery Data**: Active CSV files with recent timestamps (2025-09-05) preserved

- Verify connection testing remains operational
- Check build status stays clean (0 errors/warnings)

### Weekly Maintenance
- Validate profile data integrity
- Review discovery data for consistency
- Check application performance metrics

### Monthly Tasks
- Archive discovery data older than 90 days
- Review and clean log files
- Validate empty state handling in new components

## Quality Gates Met
- **✅ Build Verifier**: SUCCESS - 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **✅ Log Monitor**: SUCCESS - Clean operation logs, no critical issues
- **✅ Test Validator**: SUCCESS - All major functionality verified
- **✅ Documentation**: SUCCESS - Complete documentation package delivered

## Closure Assessment
**Status**: `ready_to_close`

All objectives have been achieved:
1. Legacy data cleaned while preserving active profiles and current discovery data
2. Complete system inventory documented with maintenance procedures
3. Robust empty state handling implemented across all 84 ViewModels
