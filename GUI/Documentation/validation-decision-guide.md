## Issue Category Analysis

### Account Existence Issues
**Critical Indicators:**
- "Target account was not found"
- "Object completely missing from target"

**Decision:** IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK
**Reason:** Fundamental migration failure

### Licensing Issues
**Warning Indicators:**
- "Target user has no assigned licenses"
- "License assignment error"

**Decision:** MONITOR AND FIX
**Reason:** Can be resolved post-migration without rollback

### Permission Issues  
**Error Indicators:**
- "User is not a member of any groups"
- "Missing critical permissions"

**Decision:** EVALUATE BUSINESS IMPACT
- If business-critical access: ROLLBACK RECOMMENDED
- If non-critical access: FIX IN PLACE

### Data Integrity Issues
**Critical Indicators:**
- "Checksum mismatch detected"
- "Database corruption identified"

**Decision:** IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK
**Reason:** Data corruption cannot be tolerated

## Rollback Risk Assessment

### Safe to Rollback
- **User Accounts**: Low risk - accounts disabled, not deleted
- **Files**: Medium risk - target files removed, source preserved
- **Mailboxes**: Medium risk - migration requests cancelled

### High Risk Rollbacks
- **Databases**: HIGH RISK - target database will be DROPPED
  - Confirm source database is intact
  - Verify no critical data was modified in target
  - Have database backup ready

### Cannot Rollback
- **Completed Exchange Moves**: Use Exchange management tools
- **Deleted Source Objects**: Cannot restore without backup
- **Modified Source Systems**: May lose changes made during migration

## Business Impact Evaluation

### Questions to Ask Before Rollback

1. **User Impact**
   - How many users are affected?
   - Are they able to work with current state?
   - What is the impact on business operations?

2. **Data Criticality**
   - Is data integrity compromised?
   - Can users access their essential data?
   - Are compliance requirements being met?

3. **Time Sensitivity**
   - Is this blocking urgent business needs?
   - Can the issue wait until business hours?
   - What is the cost of extended downtime?

4. **Resolution Complexity**
   - How long will it take to fix in place?
   - Do we have the skills/tools to resolve quickly?
   - What is the risk of making it worse?

### Business Impact Scoring

| Factor | Score | Weight | Calculation |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Users Affected | 1-5 | x3 | Number of impacted users |
| Business Criticality | 1-5 | x4 | Essential vs. nice-to-have |
| Data Risk | 1-5 | x5 | Data loss/corruption potential |
| Downtime Cost | 1-5 | x3 | Revenue/productivity impact |

**Total Score Interpretation:**
- **60-75**: IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK
- **45-59**: ROLLBACK RECOMMENDED  
- **30-44**: EVALUATE OPTIONS
- **15-29**: FIX IN PLACE
- **0-14**: MONITOR ONLY

## Common Scenarios and Decisions

### Scenario 1: User Migration with Missing Groups
**Validation Result:** Warning - "User is not a member of any groups"
**Impact:** User cannot access shared resources
**Decision:** MONITOR AND FIX
**Rationale:** User account exists, can be added to groups post-migration

### Scenario 2: Mailbox with Size Discrepancy  
**Validation Result:** Error - "Mailbox size mismatch - Expected: 2.5GB, Found: 2.1GB"
**Impact:** Some emails may be missing
**Decision:** INVESTIGATE BEFORE ROLLBACK
**Action:** Check if difference is due to cleanup/archive processes

### Scenario 3: Database Not Found
**Validation Result:** Critical - "Database completely missing from target"
**Impact:** Application cannot function
**Decision:** IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK
**Rationale:** Complete migration failure, no workaround possible

### Scenario 4: File Permission Changes
**Validation Result:** Warning - "ACL differences detected"
**Impact:** Users may have different access levels
**Decision:** EVALUATE AND MONITOR
**Action:** Compare specific permissions, update if necessary

### Scenario 5: Multiple License Errors
**Validation Result:** Error - "License assignment failed for 15 users"
**Impact:** Users cannot access Office 365 services
**Decision:** FIX IN PLACE
**Rationale:** License issues can be resolved without rollback

## Rollback Execution Guidelines

### Pre-Rollback Checklist
- [ ] Document current state and issues
- [ ] Verify source systems are still intact
- [ ] Confirm rollback permissions are available
- [ ] Notify affected users of upcoming changes
- [ ] Prepare communication for business stakeholders
- [ ] Schedule rollback during maintenance window if possible

### During Rollback
- [ ] Monitor rollback progress continuously
- [ ] Document any errors or unexpected behavior
- [ ] Be prepared to stop rollback if issues arise
- [ ] Keep communication channels open with stakeholders

### Post-Rollback
- [ ] Verify source systems are fully functional
- [ ] Confirm users can access their resources
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Plan remediation strategy for next migration attempt
- [ ] Update migration procedures based on findings

## Emergency Procedures

### When Rollback Fails
1. **STOP** - Do not continue with additional rollback attempts
2. **ASSESS** - Document exactly what failed and current state
3. **ESCALATE** - Contact senior administrators immediately
4. **COMMUNICATE** - Inform stakeholders of situation
5. **MANUAL RECOVERY** - Prepare for manual recovery procedures

### Communication Templates

## Monitoring and Follow-up

### Post-Decision Monitoring

#### If Rollback Performed
- [ ] Monitor source systems for stability
- [ ] Verify user access and functionality
- [ ] Track any residual issues from rollback
- [ ] Document root cause analysis
- [ ] Plan improved migration approach

#### If Issues Fixed in Place
- [ ] Re-run validation after fixes
- [ ] Monitor for any new issues that arise
- [ ] Document resolution procedures
- [ ] Update validation thresholds if appropriate

#### If Monitoring Only
- [ ] Set up automated monitoring for warning conditions
- [ ] Establish escalation criteria for degradation
- [ ] Schedule periodic re-validation
- [ ] Document acceptable risk levels

### Success Metrics

Track the following metrics to validate decision effectiveness:

- **Resolution Time**: Time from issue detection to resolution
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on post-migration experience  
- **System Stability**: Incidents related to migration issues
- **Business Continuity**: Impact on business operations
- **Cost Impact**: Resources required for resolution
