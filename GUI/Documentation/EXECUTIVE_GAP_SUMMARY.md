## Financial Impact Estimate

### Additional Development Cost

**Assumptions:**
- 2 senior developers @ $150/hr
- 10-12 weeks
- 40 hrs/week each

**Calculation:**
- 2 developers × 12 weeks × 40 hrs/week × $150/hr = **$144,000**

### Cost of Delay

**Per Week of Delay:**
- Lost productivity: $10,000/week (estimate)
- Customer dissatisfaction: Hard to quantify
- Competitive disadvantage: Hard to quantify

**Total Cost of 12-Week Delay:**
- Development: $144,000
- Lost productivity: $120,000
- **Total Estimated Impact: $264,000**
