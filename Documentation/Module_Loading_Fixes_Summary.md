# Module Loading Fixes Summary

## Issue Description
Several modules in the M&A Discovery Suite were failing to load because they were accessing `$global:MandA` or `$global:_MandALoadingContext` at module scope (during import) before these global variables were initialized by the orchestrator.

## Root Cause
The modules were designed to expect an `Import-ModuleWithManifest` function that would set up `$global:_MandALoadingContext` before importing them, but the orchestrator was using standard `Import-Module` calls without setting up this context.

## Modules Fixed

### Processing Modules
1. **DataValidation.psm1** (Lines 27-38)
   - Removed: Global context access and path validation at module scope
   - Fixed: Moved context access to function scope

2. **UserProfileBuilder.psm1** (Lines 27-59)
   - Removed: Global context access, path validation, and directory creation at module scope
   - Fixed: Moved context access to function scope

3. **WaveGeneration.psm1** (Lines 26-48)
   - Removed: Global context access, path validation, and directory creation at module scope
   - Fixed: Moved context access to function scope

4. **DataAggregation.psm1** (Lines 33-35)
   - Removed: Global environment validation check at module scope
   - Fixed: Moved context validation to function scope

### Export Modules
1. **CSVExport.psm1** (Lines 26-31)
   - Removed: Global environment check and context path access at module scope
   - Fixed: Moved context access to function scope

2. **JSONExport.psm1** (Lines 28-32)
   - Removed: Global environment check and context path access at module scope
   - Fixed: Moved context access to function scope

3. **ExcelExport.psm1** (Lines 26-29)
   - Removed: Global environment check at module scope
   - Fixed: Moved context access to function scope

4. **PowerAppsExporter.psm1** (Lines 37-40)
   - Removed: Global environment check at module scope
   - Fixed: Moved context access to function scope

5. **CompanyControlSheetExporter.psm1** (Lines 55-58)
   - Removed: Global environment check at module scope
   - Fixed: Moved context access to function scope

## Solution Applied
For each problematic module, the following changes were made:

### Before (Problematic Code)
```powershell
# Access context information provided by the orchestrator during module import
if ($null -eq $global:_MandALoadingContext -or $null -eq $global:_MandALoadingContext.Paths) {
    throw "Module: Critical loading context not available. Module cannot initialize."
}
$ModuleScope_ContextPaths = $global:_MandALoadingContext.Paths
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```powershell
# NOTE: Context access has been moved to function scope to avoid module loading issues.
# The global context ($global:MandA) will be accessed by functions when they are called,
# rather than at module import time.
```

## Benefits of the Fix
1. **Module Loading**: Modules can now be imported without requiring pre-initialized global context
2. **Flexibility**: Functions can access the global context when they're actually called
3. **Error Prevention**: Eliminates module loading failures due to missing global variables
4. **Orchestrator Independence**: Modules are no longer tightly coupled to specific orchestrator initialization patterns

## Testing
Created `Scripts/Test-ModuleLoading.ps1` to verify that all fixed modules can be loaded successfully without errors.

All tested modules now load successfully:
- ✓ DataValidation
- ✓ UserProfileBuilder  
- ✓ WaveGeneration
- ✓ DataAggregation
- ✓ CSVExport
- ✓ JSONExport
- ✓ ExcelExport
- ✓ PowerAppsExporter
- ✓ CompanyControlSheetExporter

## Impact
- **Immediate**: Resolves module loading failures that were preventing the orchestrator from running
- **Long-term**: Improves module architecture by deferring context access to runtime rather than import time
- **Maintenance**: Reduces coupling between modules and the orchestrator's initialization sequence

## Recommendations
1. Functions within these modules should validate that `$global:MandA` exists before accessing it
2. Consider passing context as parameters to functions rather than relying on global variables
3. Update module documentation to reflect the new initialization pattern
