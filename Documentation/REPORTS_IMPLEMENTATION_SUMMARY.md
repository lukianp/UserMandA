- Loading overlays and progress indicators

### 7. Error Handling ✅

#### Comprehensive Error Management
- Try-catch blocks around all async operations

- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for missing data

#### Data Validation
- CSV file existence checks
- Header validation and mapping
- Dynamic column generation for unknown formats
- Empty state handling

### 8. Performance Optimizations ✅

#### Efficient Data Loading
- Async/await patterns throughout
- Background loading with UI thread updates

- Lazy loading of report templates

#### Memory Management
- Proper disposal of resources
- Observable collection clearing on navigation
- Weak event patterns where appropriate

## Testing Verification

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- Application builds without errors
- Only warnings related to nullable reference types (non-blocking)
- All dependencies properly resolved

### Data Loading Test: ✅ VERIFIED
- Reports.csv successfully copied to Raw directory
- CSV contains 22 realistic report entries
- Headers match expected ReportModels structure
- Data includes all required fields:
  - ReportName, Description, ReportType
  - Category, CreatedBy, Status
  - DataSources, Columns, Filters
  - Recipients, Schedule, Format

### Navigation Test: ✅ VERIFIED
- Reports view registered in ViewRegistry
- Tab creation working correctly
- View instantiation and DataContext binding
- LoadAsync method properly triggered

## Expected User Experience
