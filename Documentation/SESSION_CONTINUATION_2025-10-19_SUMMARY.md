## üîß Testing Patterns Established

### 1. Crypto UUID Mocking Pattern
**Problem:** crypto.randomUUID() not available in Jest environment
**Solution:**
```typescript
let uuidCounter = 0;
Object.defineProperty(global, 'crypto', {
  value: {
    randomUUID: jest.fn(() => {
      uuidCounter++;
      return `test-uuid-${uuidCounter.toString().padStart(4, '0')}`;
    }),
  },
  writable: true,
  configurable: true,
});

beforeEach(() => {
  uuidCounter = 0; // Reset for predictable IDs
});
```

### 2. File System Mocking Pattern
```typescript
jest.mock('fs/promises', () => ({
  mkdir: jest.fn(),
  writeFile: jest.fn(),
  readFile: jest.fn(),
}));

const mockFs = require('fs/promises');

beforeEach(() => {
  mockFs.mkdir.mockResolvedValue(undefined);
  mockFs.writeFile.mockResolvedValue(undefined);
  mockFs.readFile.mockRejectedValue(new Error('File not found'));
});
```

### 3. Event Testing Pattern
```typescript
const events: any[] = [];
service.on('event:name', data => events.push({ event: 'name', data }));

await service.methodUnderTest();

expect(events[0].event).toBe('name');
expect(events[0].data.field).toBe(expectedValue);
```

### 4. PowerShell Service Mocking Pattern
```typescript
const mockPowerShell = {
  executeScript: jest.fn(),
} as any;

mockPowerShell.executeScript.mockResolvedValue({
  success: true,
  data: { /* expected data */ },
  error: null,
});
```

### 5. CSV Parsing Mock Pattern
```typescript
jest.mock('papaparse', () => ({
  parse: jest.fn((content, options) => {
    const lines = content.split('\n');
    const headers = lines[0].split(',');
    const data = lines.slice(1).map(line => {
      const values = line.split(',').map(v => v.replace(/^"|"$/g, ''));
      const obj = {};
      headers.forEach((h, i) => obj[h] = values[i]);
      return obj;
    });
    options.complete({ data });
    return { data };
  }),
}));
```

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Crypto Mock Pattern:** Using Object.defineProperty solved UUID generation issues instantly
2. **Incremental Testing:** Creating all tests first, then running, allowed quick iteration
3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Following migrationExecutionService pattern accelerated development
4. **Consistent Mocking:** Established patterns from previous session applied perfectly

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Crypto Global:** crypto.randomUUID() is read-only, required Object.defineProperty
2. **CSV Parsing:** PapaParse needed custom mock for test environment
3. **Service Complexity:** conflictResolutionService had 7 resolution strategies to test

### Best Practices Established
1. Always mock crypto.randomUUID() for services that create unique IDs
2. Test all resolution/mapping strategies comprehensively
3. Include edge cases (empty inputs, large datasets, special characters)
4. Verify events are emitted correctly for all major operations
5. Test both success and failure paths for every method
6. Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested

---

## üöÄ Recommendations for Next Session

### Immediate Priorities (1-2 hours)
1. **Fix migrationValidationService:**
   - Implement missing `getReportsByWave()` method OR
   - Remove tests for unimplemented method
   - Target: 80%+ pass rate (currently 61.1%)

2. **Fix powerShellService:**
   - Fix mock data structure for remaining 2 tests
   - Target: 100% pass rate (currently 93.8%)

### Follow-up Work (1 week)
3. **Integration Tests:** Test service interactions (planning ‚Üí execution ‚Üí rollback)
4. **E2E Tests:** Complete migration workflows (discovery ‚Üí plan ‚Üí validate ‚Üí execute)
5. **Additional Services:** Create tests for remaining 5 migration services

### Long-term Goals
6. **CI/CD Integration:** Automated test execution on commit
7. **Coverage Reporting:** Track coverage trends over time
8. **Performance Testing:** Large-scale migration scenarios (1000+ users)
9. **Load Testing:** Concurrent wave execution limits

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Pattern Replication Works:** Once a good pattern is established (crypto mock), similar services can be tested rapidly
2. **100% Pass Rate Achievable:** All 3 new services achieved 100% on first or second attempt
3. **Comprehensive Mocking Essential:** Properly mocked dependencies eliminate environment dependencies
4. **Event Testing Critical:** Event emission verification catches integration issues early
5. **Edge Cases Matter:** Testing with empty inputs, large datasets, special characters prevents production bugs

---

## üìû Handoff Notes for Next Developer

### To Continue This Work:
1. Review the test patterns in any of the 5 completed service test files (all are reference implementations)
2. Use the same mock structure for PowerShell, crypto, and filesystem interactions
3. Focus on testing public API methods comprehensively
4. Include error recovery tests for every success test
5. Verify events are emitted at appropriate times

### To Fix Remaining Issues:
1. **migrationValidationService:** Implement `getReportsByWave` method in service or remove tests
2. **powerShellService:** Fix data structure in mock responses (result.data.users)

### To Add New Service Tests:
1. Copy structure from any completed service test file (all follow same pattern)
2. Replace service-specific logic while keeping test categories
3. Run tests incrementally: Initialize ‚Üí Main methods ‚Üí Error recovery ‚Üí Edge cases
4. Aim for 80%+ pass rate before moving to next service
