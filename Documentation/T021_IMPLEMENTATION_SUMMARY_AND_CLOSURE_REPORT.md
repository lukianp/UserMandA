## Technical Implementation Details

### ConfigurationService Architecture
```csharp
public class ConfigurationService
{
    private static readonly Lazy<ConfigurationService> _instance = 
        new Lazy<ConfigurationService>(() => new ConfigurationService());
    
    public static ConfigurationService Instance => _instance.Value;
    
    public string GetDiscoveryDataPath()
    {
        // Environment variable override support
        var envPath = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MANDA_DISCOVERY_PATH");
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(envPath) && Directory.Exists(envPath))
            return NormalizePath(envPath);
        
        // Default path fallback
        return NormalizePath(@"c:\discoverydata");
    }
}
```

**Resolution**: Implemented case-insensitive normalization to lowercase with backward compatibility
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved with comprehensive testing validation

### Issue 3: Environment Variable Management
**Problem**: Complex deployment scenarios requiring different data paths
**Resolution**: MANDA_DISCOVERY_PATH environment variable with validation and fallback logic
**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved with complete integration testing
