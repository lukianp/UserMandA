# ADR-011: UserDetailView Single-Pane Architecture and Implementation

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Task:** T-011 Users — Detailed View (single pane)  
**Participants:** architecture-lead, gui-module-executor, documentation-qa-guardian  

## Context and Problem Statement

The M&A Discovery Suite required a comprehensive user detail interface that could consolidate information from multiple discovery sources into a single, actionable view. Previous implementations relied on multiple windows or separate screens, creating workflow inefficiencies and incomplete user context during migration planning.

Key challenges addressed:
- Fragmented user information across multiple data sources
- Inefficient navigation between related user data
- Lack of real-time data integration from LogicEngineService
- Missing migration workflow integration
- Inadequate user experience for complex enterprise scenarios

## Decision Drivers

### Functional Requirements
- **Single-Pane Access:** Complete user information in one view
- **Real-time Data Integration:** Live connection to LogicEngineService
- **Migration Workflow Integration:** Direct actions for wave management and export
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** 9 distinct data categories for complete user profile
- **Performance Requirements:** Sub-100ms response times for UI operations

### Technical Requirements
- **MVVM Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns
- **Async Data Loading:** Non-blocking UI operations
- **Memory Efficiency:** Support for large enterprise datasets
- **Theme Integration:** Dynamic resource theming support

- Difficult cross-data relationships visualization

### Option 2: Master-Detail with Side Panel
**Description:** List view with expandable detail panel

**Pros:**
- Space-efficient layout
- Quick user switching capability
- Consistent with modern web applications

**Cons:**
- Limited space for comprehensive data display
- Complex responsive design requirements
- Reduced visibility of related information

### Option 3: Single-Pane Tab Interface (SELECTED)
**Description:** Comprehensive tab-based interface with integrated actions

**Pros:**
- Complete data visibility in unified interface
- Logical organization with tab categorization
- Efficient memory usage with single ViewModel
- Direct integration with migration workflow actions
- Professional enterprise application appearance

**Cons:**
- Potential information overload for simple scenarios
- Higher initial development complexity
- Requires careful tab organization and naming

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** Single-Pane Tab Interface (Option 3)

### Rationale
The single-pane tab interface provides the optimal balance of comprehensive data access, user experience, and technical architecture for enterprise M&A scenarios. The decision prioritizes workflow efficiency and complete context visibility over interface simplicity.

### Implementation Architecture

#### Core Components
1. **UserDetailViewModel:** Central coordinator with LogicEngineService integration
2. **UserDetailView:** 9-tab XAML interface with custom styling
3. **UserDetailWindow:** Modal container for focused user analysis

#### Data Integration Pattern
```
LogicEngineService → UserDetailProjection → Tab-Specific Collections → UI Binding
```

#### Command Architecture
- **AddToMigrationWaveCommand:** Direct wave management integration
- **ExportSnapshotCommand:** Complete user profile export
- **RefreshDataCommand:** Real-time data synchronization
- **CloseCommand:** Proper resource cleanup and navigation

### Tab Organization Design

#### Tab Categorization Logic
1. **Overview:** Executive summary and metrics
2. **Devices:** Hardware and infrastructure dependencies
3. **Apps:** Software licensing and compatibility
4. **Groups:** Security and permission inheritance
5. **GPOs:** Policy and configuration management
6. **File Access:** Data access and migration requirements
7. **Mailbox:** Email migration sizing and planning
8. **Azure Roles:** Cloud permission recreation
9. **SQL & Risks:** Database dependencies and security issues

#### Navigation Flow Design
```
Users Grid → Details Button → UserDetailWindow → Tab Selection → Actions → Close/Export
```

### Service Integration Architecture

#### LogicEngineService Integration
- **Async Data Loading:** Non-blocking user experience
- **UserDetailProjection:** Type-safe data contracts
