            }
            
            # Start migration with progress streaming
            $migration.StartMigration() | ForEach-Object {
                Write-Progress -Activity 'User Migration' -Status $_.Status -PercentComplete $_.Progress
                Write-Output $_

        // Correlate users with mailboxes
        var userMailboxMap = discovery.Users
            .Join(discovery.Mailboxes,
                u => u.PrimarySmtpAddress,
                m => m.PrimarySmtpAddress,
                (u, m) => new { User = u, Mailbox = m });

### 4.3 Real-Time Progress Streaming

```csharp
// SignalR-like progress streaming to UI

    public IObservable<MigrationProgress> ProgressStream => _progressSubject.AsObservable();
    
    public void StreamProgress(string sessionId, MigrationProgress progress)
    {
        // Update UI through MVVM binding
        Application.Current.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(() =>
        {
            progress.Timestamp = DateTime.Now;
            progress.SessionId = sessionId;

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for building an enterprise-grade migration platform that exceeds ShareGate and Quest Migration Manager capabilities. By leveraging our existing PowerShell modules and implementing advanced features like real-time progress streaming, sophisticated group remapping, and M&A-specific orchestration, we create a unique value proposition in the migration tools market.

The modular architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and extensibility while the focus on user experience through real-time updates and intuitive interfaces sets us apart from competitors. The 70% cost advantage combined with superior features positions this platform as the premier choice for enterprise M&A migration scenarios.
