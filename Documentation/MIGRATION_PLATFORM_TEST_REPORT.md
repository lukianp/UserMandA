### Overall Assessment: **PARTIALLY READY** ⚠️

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ All migration views and ViewModels successfully created
- ✅ Core orchestration services properly implemented
- ✅ Discovery data integration confirmed (19 CSV files active)
- ✅ Service layer architecture complete

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ GUI compilation blocked by duplicate class definitions
- ❌ PowerShell modules not deployed to expected location
- ❌ Build artifacts missing due to compilation errors

## 1. Build & Compilation Testing

### Test Results
| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Project Structure** | ✅ PASS | MandADiscoverySuite.csproj exists and valid |
| **Build Process** | ❌ FAIL | 110 compilation errors detected |
| **Binary Output** | ❌ FAIL | DLL not generated due to build errors |
| **Debug Folder** | ✅ PASS | Build directories properly structured |

### Compilation Error Analysis

**Primary Issues Identified:**
1. **Duplicate Class Definitions (6 instances)**
   - `ValidationResult` defined in multiple services
   - `ResourceAllocation` conflicts between services
   - `ErrorLogEntry` vs `MigrationErrorLogEntry` naming conflict
   - `MigrationExecutionContext` duplicate definitions

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - `LogLevel.Information` enum value not found
   - `MigrationStatus.Skipped` enum value missing
   - `_logger` field not initialized in multiple ViewModels

3. **Type Resolution Issues**
   - Ambiguous reference to `PowerShellExecutionOptions`
   - Incorrect PowerShell async invocation signatures

**Resolution Steps Taken:**
- ✅ Added missing `using System.Threading.Tasks`
- ✅ Renamed conflicting classes (e.g., `ThrottledResourceAllocation`)
- ✅ Fixed enum references to match defined values
- ⚠️ Logger initialization still pending in ViewModels
