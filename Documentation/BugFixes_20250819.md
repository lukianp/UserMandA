# Bug Fixes Applied - August 19, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. UI Responsiveness Issues
**Problem**: UI was unresponsive when clicking left menu items  
**Solution**: Modified `ParameterizedAsyncCommand` in MainViewModel to use `Task.Run` with `ConfigureAwait(false)` to prevent UI thread blocking. Also updated TabsService to load view data asynchronously without blocking.

### 2. CSV Warning Banners
**Problem**: 12 red warning banners cluttering the Discovery Dashboard  
**Solution**: Consolidated and deduplicated warnings in DiscoveryDashboardViewModel. Now shows maximum 3 aggregated warnings with column counts instead of individual banners for each file.

### 3. Users View Hanging
**Problem**: Users view was hanging and not loading data in real time  
**Solution**: Added UI thread dispatching in UsersViewModelNew using `Application.Current.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync` to ensure collection updates happen on the UI thread.

### 4. Infrastructure View Loading
**Problem**: Infrastructure not loading items instantly  
**Solution**: Applied same UI thread dispatching fix to InfrastructureViewModelNew.

### 5. File Servers View Theme
**Problem**: File Servers view was bright white, not respecting dark theme  
**Solution**: Created shared `DataGridTheme.xaml` resource dictionary with proper theme-aware styling for DataGrid controls.

### 6. Databases View Theme
**Problem**: Databases view was also bright white  
**Solution**: Applied the same DataGridTheme.xaml styling.

### 7. Security (Group Policy) View
**Problem**: Security view was showing "needs to be implemented in view registry" error  
**Solution**: Updated ViewRegistry.cs to map "security" key to GroupPoliciesViewNew instead of SecurityView.

### 8. Consistent Theme Application
**Problem**: Dark theme not consistently applied across all views  
**Solution**: Created centralized DataGridTheme.xaml and applied to all ViewNew XAML files (Users, Groups, Applications, Infrastructure, FileServers, Databases, GroupPolicies).
