## 🔧 **AREAS REQUIRING RECONSTRUCTION**

### 1. **File System Migration (Missing Core ShareGate Feature)**

**Current Gap**: No file system migration capabilities found
**ShareGate Inspiration**: File server content migration, SharePoint migration

**Required Implementation**:
```powershell
# New Module: Modules/Migration/FileSystemMigration.psm1
class FileSystemMigration {
    [string]$SourcePath
    [string]$TargetPath
    [hashtable]$MigrationConfig
    [array]$FileBatches
    
    # Core methods needed:
    [hashtable] DiscoverFileShares()
    [hashtable] AnalyzeFilePermissions() 
    [hashtable] CreateFileMigrationBatches()
    [hashtable] ExecuteFileContentMigration()
    [hashtable] MigrateSharePermissions()
    [hashtable] ValidateFileIntegrity()
}
```

### 2. **PowerShell-to-GUI Integration Bridge**

**Current Gap**: GUI uses mock data, PowerShell modules not integrated
**Required**: Service layer to bridge PowerShell functionality to C# ViewModels

**Implementation Needed**:
```csharp
// New Service: GUI/Services/MigrationOrchestrationService.cs
public class MigrationOrchestrationService
{
    // Integrate PowerShell modules with GUI
    public async Task<MigrationEnvironmentInfo> AnalyzeEnvironmentAsync();
    public async Task<ValidationResults> RunPreFlightValidationAsync();
    public async Task<MigrationProgress> StartMigrationAsync(MigrationConfig config);
    public async Task<MigrationStatus> GetMigrationStatusAsync();
    
    // Real-time progress updates via SignalR
    public event EventHandler<MigrationProgressUpdate> ProgressUpdated;
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Migration Types**

**Current Coverage**:
- ✅ Mailbox Migration (Exchange/O365)
- ✅ User Account Migration (AD)
- ⚠️ Application Migration (basic framework)
- ❌ File System Migration (missing)
- ❌ SharePoint Migration (missing)
- ❌ Teams Migration (missing)

**Required Additions**:
```powershell
# Modules/Migration/SharePointMigration.psm1 - SharePoint content migration
# Modules/Migration/TeamsMigration.psm1 - Teams/collaboration migration  
# Modules/Migration/FileServerMigration.psm1 - File share content & permissions
```

### 4. **Real-Time Progress & Monitoring**

**Current State**: GUI shows mock progress data
**Required**: Live integration with PowerShell execution

**Implementation Plan**:
```csharp
// Real-time progress via background services
public class MigrationMonitoringService
{
    public async Task<MigrationMetrics> GetLiveMetricsAsync();
    public async Task<List<MigrationEvent>> GetActivityLogAsync();
    public async Task<MigrationHealth> CheckMigrationHealthAsync();
}
```
