# M&A Discovery Suite - Discovery Session Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed from "zedra" Discovery Session

Based on the discovery session summary that showed:
- **Total Execution Time:** 14 minutes 23 seconds
- **Successful Modules:** 3 (SQLServer, EnvironmentDetection partial, Teams partial)
- **Failed Modules:** 9
- **Key Issue:** Timeout errors preventing modules from completing

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Timeout Configuration Changes

**Problem:** Modules were timing out after 5 minutes (300 seconds), preventing completion of long-running tasks like EnvironmentDetection and Teams discovery.

**Solution:** Increased timeout values across the board:

#### Core Orchestrator Changes (`Core/MandA-Orchestrator.ps1`)
- **Line 1041:** Changed `$stuckJobThreshold = 300` to `$stuckJobThreshold = 3600` (1 hour)
- **Rationale:** Teams module was processing 160/395 teams when it timed out, indicating it needed more time

#### Configuration Changes (`Configuration/default-config.json`)
- **Lines 45-52:** Updated timeout configuration:
  ```json
  "timeouts": {
      "default": 3600,
      "discovery": 3600,
      "export": 3600,
      "authentication": 600,
      "moduleExecution": 3600,
      "longRunningTasks": 3600
  }
  ```

### 2. PowerShell Module Preloading

**Problem:** Several modules reported "Exchange Online PowerShell not available" and other module loading issues.

**Solution:** Enhanced module preloading in runspace session state:

#### Core Orchestrator Changes (`Core/MandA-Orchestrator.ps1`)
- **Lines 824-870:** Added comprehensive PowerShell module preloading:
  - Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
  - Microsoft.Graph.Users
  - Microsoft.Graph.Groups
  - Microsoft.Graph.Applications
  - Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement
  - Microsoft.Graph.Identity.SignIns
  - Microsoft.Graph.Reports
  - Microsoft.Graph.DeviceManagement
  - ExchangeOnlineManagement
  - ActiveDirectory
  - Az.Accounts
  - Az.Resources

- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Added try-catch blocks for module loading with graceful fallback
- **Availability Check:** Modules are only loaded if available, preventing errors

### 3. DataAggregation Context Validation Fix

**Problem:** Processing phase failed with "Context does not contain 'Paths' property" error.

**Solution:** Enhanced context validation in DataAggregation module:

#### DataAggregation Changes (`Modules/Processing/DataAggregation.psm1`)
- **Lines 983-1002:** Enhanced context validation with support for both hashtable and PSObject contexts
- **Lines 1008-1035:** Improved path validation with better error messages and debugging
- **Added Fallback Logic:** Handles both `$Context.Paths` and `$Context['Paths']` access patterns

### 4. Graph Discovery Module Analysis

**Status:** Graph module appears to be functioning correctly based on code review.

**Key Features:**
- Proper error handling and logging
- Connection testing with `Test-GraphConnection`
- Comprehensive user and group discovery
- Proper DiscoveryResult object usage
- Export functionality for CSV files

**Potential Issues:**
- Requires Microsoft Graph connection to be established
- Depends on proper permissions for Graph API access

## Module Status Assessment

### Modules That Should Now Work Better:

1. **EnvironmentDetection** ✅ - Timeout increased from 5 minutes to 1 hour
2. **Teams** ✅ - Timeout increased, was processing 160/395 teams when stopped
3. **Exchange** ✅ - ExchangeOnlineManagement module now preloaded
4. **ExternalIdentity** ✅ - ExchangeOnlineManagement module now preloaded
5. **FileServer** ✅ - Should benefit from increased timeout
6. **Azure** ✅ - Az.Accounts and Az.Resources modules now preloaded
7. **NetworkInfrastructure** ✅ - Should benefit from increased timeout

### Modules Already Working:
1. **SQLServer** ✅ - Already completed successfully (2m 13s)
2. **ActiveDirectory** ✅ - Skipped (already had 94,993 records)
3. **GPO** ✅ - Skipped (already had 64 records)
4. **Graph** ✅ - Skipped (already had 8,616 records)
5. **Intune** ✅ - Skipped (already had 1,912 records)

### Configuration Issues to Address:

1. **SharePoint** ❌ - Tenant name configured in config as "zedra" but may need verification
2. **Licensing** ❌ - Graph API query error (custom page sizes not supported) - may need Graph API configuration adjustment

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** by running the discovery again with profile "zedra"
2. **Monitor execution times** to ensure modules complete within the 1-hour timeout
3. **Verify SharePoint configuration** if SharePoint discovery is still failing
4. **Check Graph API permissions** for Licensing module if it continues to fail
5. **Review log files** for any remaining issues

## Expected Improvements

- **Timeout-related failures should be eliminated** for EnvironmentDetection and Teams modules
- **Module loading errors should be reduced** due to preloading of required PowerShell modules
- **Processing phase should complete successfully** due to enhanced context validation
- **Overall success rate should improve** from 3/12 to potentially 9-10/12 modules

## Files Modified

1. `Core/MandA-Orchestrator.ps1` - Timeout and module preloading fixes
2. `Configuration/default-config.json` - Timeout configuration updates
3. `Modules/Processing/DataAggregation.psm1` - Context validation improvements

## Testing Recommendation

Run the discovery again with the same "zedra" profile to validate these fixes:

```powershell
.\QuickStart.ps1 -CompanyName "zedra" -Force
```

The `-Force` parameter will ensure all modules run again even if previous data exists, allowing for a complete test of the timeout and module loading fixes.
