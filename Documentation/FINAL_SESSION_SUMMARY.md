## 🔧 Testing Patterns Established

### 1. Mock Setup Pattern
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();

  // Mock dependencies
  mockPowerShell.executeScript = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    success: true,
    data: {},
    error: null,
  });

  service = new ServiceClass(mockPowerShell, testDataDir);
});
```

### 2. Event Testing Pattern
```typescript
const events: any[] = [];
service.on('event:name', (data) => events.push({ event: 'name', data }));

await service.methodUnderTest();

expect(events[0]).toMatchObject({
  event: 'name',
  data: { expectedField: expectedValue },
});
```

### 3. Error Recovery Pattern
```typescript
mockPowerShell.executeScript = jest.fn().mockRejectedValue(
  new Error('Expected failure')
);

const result = await service.methodUnderTest();

expect(result.success).toBe(false);
expect(result.errors.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
```

### 4. Async Operation Pattern
```typescript
let closeHandler: any;
(mockProcess.on as jest.Mock).mockImplementation((event, handler) => {
  if (event === 'close') {
    closeHandler = handler;
  }
  return mockProcess;
});

// Start operation
const promise = service.methodUnderTest();

// Trigger completion
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
if (closeHandler) closeHandler(0);

const result = await promise;
expect(result).toBeDefined();
```

5. Test error messages and remediation suggestions
6. Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested

### Follow-up Work
4. **Integration Tests:** Test service interactions (main ↔ renderer IPC)
5. **E2E Tests:** Full migration workflows (discovery → plan → validate → execute → rollback)
6. **Renderer Service Tests:** Start with critical services (discoveryService, exportService)

### Long-term Goals
7. **CI/CD Integration:** Automated test execution on commit
8. **Coverage Reporting:** Track coverage trends over time
9. **Performance Testing:** Large-scale migration scenarios
10. **Load Testing:** Concurrent wave execution limits

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **Testing Critical Services First:** Focusing on data safety services (rollback, validation) provides highest ROI
2. **Pattern Replication:** Once a good pattern is established, similar services can be tested rapidly
3. **Comprehensive Mocking:** Properly mocked dependencies eliminate environment dependencies
4. **Iterative Improvement:** 100% pass rate achieved through 3-4 iterations, not first attempt
5. **Event Testing:** Event emission verification catches integration issues early

## 📞 Handoff Notes for Next Developer

### To Continue This Work:
1. Review the test patterns in `migrationExecutionService.test.ts` (reference implementation)
2. Use the same mock structure for PowerShell and filesystem interactions
3. Focus on testing public API methods comprehensively
4. Include error recovery tests for every success test
5. Verify events are emitted at appropriate times

### To Fix Remaining Issues:
1. **migrationValidationService:** Implement `getReportsByWave` method in service or remove tests
2. **powerShellService:** Fix data structure in mock responses (result.data.users)

### To Add New Service Tests:
1. Copy structure from `rollbackService.test.ts` (most complete example)
2. Replace service-specific logic while keeping test categories
3. Run tests incrementally: Initialize → Main methods → Error recovery → Edge cases
4. Aim for 80%+ pass rate before moving to next service

**Session Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Next Session:** Continue with migrationPlanningService and conflictResolutionService tests
**Estimated Time to 80% Critical Service Coverage:** 8-10 additional hours
