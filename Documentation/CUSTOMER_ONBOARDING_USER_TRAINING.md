## 5. MIGRATION PLANNING & EXECUTION

### 5.1 Wave-Based Migration Planning

#### Understanding Migration Waves
Migration waves organize users and resources into manageable groups for sequential migration:

```yaml
Wave Planning Principles:
  - Business Priority: Critical users and systems first
  - Technical Dependencies: Respect system interdependencies
  - Resource Constraints: Match available resources
  - Risk Management: Minimize business disruption
  - Rollback Capability: Ensure recovery options
```

#### Creating Migration Waves
**Step-by-Step Wave Creation**:

1. **Navigate to Planning → Wave Management**
2. **Click "Create New Wave"**
3. **Configure Wave Properties**:
   ```yaml
   Wave Configuration:
     Name: "Wave 1 - Executive Team"
     Description: "C-suite and direct reports migration"
     Priority: "High"
     
   Scheduling:
     Start Date: "2025-09-01 06:00"
     End Date: "2025-09-01 18:00"
     Business Hours Only: true
     
   Resources:
     Migration Specialists: 2
     Technical Support: 1
     PowerShell Runners: 3
   ```

4. **Add Users to Wave**:
   - Search and select users
   - Bulk import from CSV
   - Filter by department/criteria
   - Validate dependencies

5. **Configure Migration Options**:
   ```yaml

     Group Membership: "Maintain + Remap"
     File Share Access: "Replicate ACLs"
     
   Advanced Options:
     Pre-Migration Testing: true
     Rollback Plan: "Automatic"
     Notification Emails: true
     Progress Reporting: "Real-time"
   ```

### 5.2 Advanced Group Remapping

#### Group Mapping Strategies
The system provides sophisticated group remapping capabilities:

**Naming Convention Mapping**:
```yaml
Pattern Matching Rules:
  Source Pattern: "SOURCE-{Department}-{Function}"
  Target Pattern: "TARGET-{Department}-{Function}"
  
Example Mappings:
  "SOURCE-IT-Admins" → "TARGET-IT-Admins"
  "SOURCE-HR-Managers" → "TARGET-HR-Managers"
  "SOURCE-Finance-Users" → "TARGET-Finance-Users"
```

**Manual Override Mapping**:
```yaml
Specific Group Mappings:
  "Old-Legacy-Group" → "New-Modern-Group"
  "Temp-Project-Team" → "DELETE"
  "Special-Access-Group" → "SPLIT:Group1,Group2"
```

**Conflict Resolution**:
```yaml
Conflict Handling:
  Duplicate Names: "Append-Source-Suffix"
  Missing Target Groups: "Create-Automatically"
  Permission Conflicts: "Merge-Permissions"
  Nested Groups: "Flatten-Hierarchy"
```

#### Group Mapping Workflow
**Implementing Group Remapping**:

1. **Analyze Source Groups**:
   - Review all discovered security groups
   - Identify naming patterns and hierarchies
   - Document current group purposes and memberships

2. **Design Target Group Structure**:
   - Define new naming conventions
   - Plan group hierarchy and nesting
   - Identify groups for consolidation/elimination

3. **Create Mapping Rules**:
   ```yaml
   Rule Types:
     Pattern-Based: Automatic mapping using patterns
     Explicit: Manual one-to-one mappings
     Transformation: Complex mapping logic
     Conditional: Rules based on group properties
   ```

4. **Validate Mapping Logic**:
   - Test mapping rules against sample data
   - Review generated target group structure
   - Verify permission inheritance

5. **Execute Group Migration**:
   - Create target groups as needed
   - Migrate group memberships
   - Update security permissions
   - Validate final group structure

### 5.3 Migration Execution Monitoring

  - In Progress: Currently migrating
  - Completed: Successfully finished
  - Failed: Encountered errors
  - Rolled Back: Reverted due to issues
```

#### Handling Migration Issues
**Common Issue Resolution**:

1. **Authentication Failures**:
   ```yaml
   Symptoms: "Access denied" errors during migration
   Causes: 
     - Expired service account credentials
     - Insufficient permissions
     - Network connectivity issues
   Resolution:
     - Verify service account status
     - Check permission assignments
     - Test network connectivity
   ```

2. **Mailbox Migration Delays**:

   Symptoms: Slow migration progress, timeouts
   Causes:
     - Large mailbox sizes
     - Network bandwidth limitations
     - Exchange server load
   Resolution:
     - Implement batch processing
     - Schedule during off-peak hours
     - Increase timeout values
   ```

3. **Group Membership Conflicts**:
   ```yaml
   Symptoms: Users missing from expected groups
   Causes:
     - Group mapping rule errors
     - Circular group dependencies
     - Target group doesn't exist
   Resolution:
