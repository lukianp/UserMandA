## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **MigrationModuleInterface Architecture**

```csharp
// Real PowerShell execution with progress streaming
public async Task<MigrationResult> ExecuteUserMigrationAsync(
    UserMigrationRequest request,
    IProgress<MigrationProgressInfo> progress,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    // Load PowerShell module
    var moduleResult = await _powerShellService.ExecuteModuleAsync(
        @"D:\Scripts\UserMandA\Modules\Migration\UserMigration.psm1",
        "Import-Module", parameters, options, cancellationToken);
    
    // Create migration configuration
    var migrationResult = await _powerShellService.ExecuteModuleAsync(
        @"D:\Scripts\UserMandA\Modules\Migration\UserMigration.psm1",
        "New-UserMigration", migrationParams, options, cancellationToken);
    
    // Execute with real-time progress
    return await ExecuteMigrationWithProgressAsync(
        "UserMigration", request.MigrationId, request.Users, 
        progress, cancellationToken);
}
```

### **Real-Time Progress Streaming**

```csharp
// Live progress reporting during migration execution
progress?.Report(new MigrationProgressInfo 
{ 
    ItemId = migrationId,
    Phase = "Processing",
    PercentComplete = itemProgress,
    Message = $"Migrating {migrationType}: {item} ({i + 1}/{items.Count})",
    CurrentItem = item,
    Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow
});
```

### **PowerShell Module Integration**

```powershell
# UserMigration.psm1 - Successfully loaded and executed from C#
$migration = New-UserMigration -SourceDomain "contoso.local" -TargetDomain "fabrikam.com"
# Output: Migration created: contoso.local -> fabrikam.com
```
