# Logging and Dashboard Window Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The logging and dashboard window were only showing data from 2 days ago instead of real-time data during script execution. The monitor window was open and refreshing but not displaying current activity.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing Logging Initialization
The main problem was that **the orchestrator never called `Initialize-Logging`**. This meant:
- No log files were being created during orchestrator execution
- All logging fell back to basic `Write-Host` output (console only)
- The dashboard had no current log files to monitor

### Secondary Issues:
1. **Hardcoded Log Path**: The EnhancedLogging module used a hardcoded default path instead of the global context's log path
2. **Poor Dashboard Feedback**: The monitor didn't clearly indicate when logs were stale or when the discovery process wasn't running
3. **No Real-time Detection**: The dashboard didn't detect when new log files were created or when existing files were updated

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Orchestrator Logging Initialization
**File**: `Core/MandA-Orchestrator.ps1`
**Changes**:
- Added logging initialization after the EnhancedLogging module is loaded
- Added error handling for logging initialization failures
- Added verification that the Initialize-Logging function is available

```powershell
# Initialize logging system after EnhancedLogging module is loaded
if ($module -eq "EnhancedLogging") {
    if (Get-Command "Initialize-Logging" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
        Write-OrchestratorLog -Message "Initializing logging system..." -Level "INFO"
        try {
            Initialize-Logging -Context $global:MandA
            Write-OrchestratorLog -Message "Logging system initialized successfully" -Level "SUCCESS"
        } catch {
            Write-OrchestratorLog -Message "Failed to initialize logging system: $_" -Level "ERROR"
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging Module Context Awareness
**File**: `Modules/Utilities/EnhancedLogging.psm1`
**Changes**:
- Modified `Initialize-Logging` to use the global context's log path
- Added fallback to default path if context is not available
- Added verbose logging about which path is being used

```powershell
# Use context log path if available, otherwise use default
if ($Context -and $Context.Paths -and $Context.Paths.LogOutput) {
    $script:LoggingConfig.LogPath = $Context.Paths.LogOutput
    Write-Host "[EnhancedLogging.Initialize-Logging] Using context log path: $($script:LoggingConfig.LogPath)" -ForegroundColor Green
} elseif ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($script:LoggingConfig.LogPath)) {
    $script:LoggingConfig.LogPath = "C:\MandADiscovery\Logs"
    Write-Host "[EnhancedLogging.Initialize-Logging] Using default log path: $($script:LoggingConfig.LogPath)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Dashboard Monitoring
**File**: `Scripts/Show-LogMonitor.ps1`
**Changes**:
- Added refresh counter to show activity
- Added detection of new log files
- Added detection of log file updates (size changes)
- Enhanced status indicators (ACTIVE/RECENT/IDLE)
- Added age display for log files
- Added warnings when logs are stale
- Added troubleshooting information when no logs are found

**Key Improvements**:
- Real-time detection: `>>> NEW LOG FILE DETECTED <<<` and `>>> LOG FILE UPDATED <<<`
- Better status indicators with timestamps
- Warning when most recent log is over 5 minutes old
- Troubleshooting guidance when no logs are found

### 4. Created Logging System Test Script
**File**: `Scripts/Test-LoggingSystem.ps1`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test to verify the logging system is working correctly
**Features**:
- Verifies global context initialization
- Tests log directory creation
- Loads and tests the EnhancedLogging module
- Initializes logging system
- Tests all log levels (INFO, SUCCESS, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG, HEADER)
- Verifies log file creation
- Shows sample log content
- Provides instructions for running the monitor

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test the Logging System
```powershell
# Run the logging test script
.\Scripts\Test-LoggingSystem.ps1 -CompanyName "TestCompany"
```

### 2. Run the Enhanced Dashboard
```powershell
# Start the log monitor (use the path from the test output)
.\Scripts\Show-LogMonitor.ps1 -CompanyName "TestCompany" -LogPath "C:\MandADiscovery\Logs"
```

### 3. Run the Orchestrator
```powershell
# In another terminal, run the orchestrator to generate real-time logs
.\Core\MandA-Orchestrator.ps1 -CompanyName "TestCompany" -Mode "Discovery"
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### During Orchestrator Execution:
1. **Log files are created** in real-time with timestamps in the filename
2. **Dashboard shows live updates** with "NEW LOG FILE DETECTED" and "LOG FILE UPDATED" messages
3. **Status indicators** show [ACTIVE] for files being written to
4. **Real-time log entries** appear in the dashboard as they're written

### When Orchestrator is Not Running:
1. **Dashboard shows warnings** when logs are stale (over 5 minutes old)
2. **Status indicators** show [IDLE] for old files
3. **Troubleshooting information** is displayed when no logs are found
4. **Clear feedback** about the discovery process status

## Technical Details

### Log File Naming Convention
- Format: `MandA_Discovery_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- Example: `MandA_Discovery_20250608_172700.log`
- Each orchestrator run creates a new timestamped log file

### Dashboard Refresh Logic
- Refreshes every 3 seconds
- Tracks log file changes by size and modification time
- Provides visual feedback for new files and updates
- Shows age of log files in seconds/minutes

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when logging initialization fails
- Console output continues even if file logging fails
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Files Modified
1. `Core/MandA-Orchestrator.ps1` - Added logging initialization
2. `Modules/Utilities/EnhancedLogging.psm1` - Enhanced context awareness
3. `Scripts/Show-LogMonitor.ps1` - Enhanced real-time monitoring
4. `Scripts/Test-LoggingSystem.ps1` - New test script (created)

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Logging system initializes correctly
2. ✅ Log files are created with proper timestamps
3. ✅ Dashboard detects new log files in real-time
4. ✅ Dashboard shows live updates during orchestrator execution
5. ✅ Dashboard provides clear feedback when orchestrator is not running
6. ✅ Error handling works correctly for various failure scenarios

## Test Results (Verified Working)

- **Status**: PASSED
- **Log File Created**: `MandA_Discovery_20250608_173410.log`
- **All Log Levels Working**: INFO, SUCCESS, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG, HEADER

- **Proper Formatting**: ✅ (timestamps, levels, components, messages)

### ✅ Dashboard Monitor Test
- **Status**: WORKING CORRECTLY
- **Real-time Detection**: ✅ Shows [ACTIVE], [RECENT], [IDLE] status
- **File Age Tracking**: ✅ Shows time since last modification
- **Auto-refresh**: ✅ Every 3 seconds with refresh counter
- **Log Display**: ✅ Shows last 100 lines (updated per user request)
- **Multiple Log Files**: ✅ Displays up to 5 most recent files

### ✅ Orchestrator Integration Test
- **Status**: WORKING
- **Logging Initialization**: ✅ Automatically called after EnhancedLogging module load
- **Real-time Logging**: ✅ Live log entries during orchestrator execution
- **Context-aware Paths**: ✅ Uses correct log paths from global context

### Dashboard Features Confirmed Working:
- Real-time file detection with ">>> NEW LOG FILE DETECTED <<<" messages
- File update detection with ">>> LOG FILE UPDATED <<<" messages
- Status indicators: [ACTIVE] (< 2 min), [RECENT] (< 10 min), [IDLE] (> 10 min)
- Age display in seconds/minutes
- Warning when logs are stale (> 5 minutes old)
- Troubleshooting guidance when no logs found
- Color-coded log entries by level (ERROR=Red, WARN=Yellow, SUCCESS=Green, etc.)

The logging and dashboard system now provides comprehensive real-time monitoring of the M&A Discovery Suite execution with clear visual feedback and proper error handling.
