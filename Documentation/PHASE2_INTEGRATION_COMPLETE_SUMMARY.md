## Architecture Highlights

### Thread-Safe Design
- All services use proper locking mechanisms
- UI updates dispatched safely to UI thread
- Concurrent execution support with proper resource management
- Real-time updates maintain existing patterns

### Real-Time Integration
- Maintains 2-30 second update frequencies established in Phase 1
- Preserves existing UI responsiveness patterns
- Seamless transition from simulation to live data
- No disruption to user experience

### Error Handling & Recovery
- Comprehensive exception handling at all levels
- Graceful degradation when PowerShell fails
- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Detailed logging and diagnostics

### Resource Management
- Proper PowerShell runspace lifecycle management
- Memory-efficient progress tracking
- Automatic cleanup of completed executions
- Configurable resource limits

### Extensibility
- Modular design allows easy addition of new migration types
- Plugin architecture for discovery modules
- Configurable execution parameters
- Extensible state management system

## Integration Approach

### Phase 1 (Current State)
```csharp
// Uses data generators for simulation
var metrics = MigrationDataGenerator.GenerateRealtimeMetrics();
var migrations = MigrationDataGenerator.GenerateActiveMigrations(3);
```

### Phase 2 (PowerShell Integration)
```csharp
// Uses real PowerShell execution
var result = await executionService.ExecuteDiscoveryModuleAsync(
    "UsersDiscovery", "CompanyName", parameters);
var metrics = progressBridge.GetCurrentDashboardMetrics();
```

### Seamless Transition
```csharp
// Phase 2 activation
var phase2Service = new Phase2IntegrationService(logger, serviceProvider);
await phase2Service.ActivatePhase2Async();

// Enhanced ViewModel creation
var enhancedViewModel = phase2Service.CreateEnhancedMigrateViewModel(logger);
// Automatically uses PowerShell instead of generators
```

## Implementation Benefits

// In Program.cs or startup
services.AddSingleton<PowerShellExecutionService>();
services.AddSingleton<MigrationStateManager>();
services.AddSingleton<PowerShellProgressBridge>();
services.AddSingleton<EnhancedMigrationCommands>();
services.AddSingleton<Phase2IntegrationService>();
```

### 3. MainWindow Integration
```csharp
// Store Phase 2 service for ViewModel access
var phase2Service = serviceProvider.GetService<Phase2IntegrationService>();
await phase2Service.ActivatePhase2Async();
MainWindow.Resources["Phase2Service"] = phase2Service;
```

### 4. ViewModel Enhancement
```csharp
// In existing ViewModels
var phase2Service = (Phase2IntegrationService)Application.Current.MainWindow.Resources["Phase2Service"];
if (phase2Service?.IsPhase2Enabled == true)
{
    // Use PowerShell integration
    var command = phase2Service.MigrationCommands.CreateDiscoveryCommand(...);
    await command.ExecuteAsync(null);
}
else
{
    // Fallback to simulation
    var metrics = MigrationDataGenerator.GenerateRealtimeMetrics();
}
```

## Performance Characteristics
