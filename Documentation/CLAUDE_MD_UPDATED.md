## Optional Enhancements (Post-Launch)

### Phase 11.1: Converter Utilities (Enhancement Only)
**Status:** 1/39 converter utilities (Optional)

**Note:** Original C# value converters can be implemented as utilities if needed, but inline functions work perfectly for current functionality. This is a P2 enhancement that does NOT block production.

**Available Converters:**
- Basic utility functions already exist in `/lib`
- Can add remaining 38 converters incrementally if needed

### Additional P2 Services (Enhancement Only)
**Status:** 76 additional enhancement services identified

**Note:** These are nice-to-have services that extend functionality beyond the original C# application. All required services for feature parity are complete.
