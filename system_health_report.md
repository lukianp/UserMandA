**Monitoring Session:** Active  
**Status:** CRITICAL ISSUES DETECTED

## üö® CRITICAL ALERTS

### [CRITICAL] Thread Safety Violations
- **Impact:** Application crashes and data corruption potential
- **Pattern:** `NotSupportedException: CollectionView does not support changes from different thread`
- **Affected Components:**
  - FileServersViewModelNew (LoadAsync)
  - GroupPoliciesViewModelNew (LoadAsync)
  - ApplicationsViewModelNew (LoadAsync)
  - InfrastructureViewModelNew (LoadAsync)
  - GroupsViewModelNew (LoadAsync)
  - DomainDiscoveryViewModel (LoadDiscoveryModulesAsync)

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** All ViewModels are attempting to modify UI collections from background threads, causing systematic failures.

### [CRITICAL] Application Process Status
- **Status:** NOT CURRENTLY RUNNING
- **Last Known Run:** 2025-08-23 20:12:46 (successful startup)
- **Startup Success:** ‚úÖ All initialization steps completed successfully
- **Issue:** Application likely crashed due to thread safety violations

### [WARNING] Data Staleness Issues
- **Multiple CSV files haven't been updated in 24+ hours:**
  - Applications.csv (last updated: 08/21/2025)
  - Applications_TestData.csv (last updated: 08/20/2025)
  - DirectoryRoles.csv (last updated: 08/21/2025)
  - ExchangeDistributionGroups.csv (last updated: 08/21/2025)

## üõ†Ô∏è REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY 1: Fix Thread Safety Issues (CRITICAL)
```csharp
// Current problematic pattern in ViewModels:
async Task LoadAsync() {
    // Background thread work
    var data = await LoadDataAsync();
    
    // ‚ùå FAILS: Direct collection modification from background thread
    Items.Clear();
    Items.AddRange(data);
}

// ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Use Dispatcher for UI thread operations
async Task LoadAsync() {
    var data = await LoadDataAsync();
    
    Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() => {
        Items.Clear();
        Items.AddRange(data);
    });
}
```

### PRIORITY 2: Data Pipeline Recovery
- Refresh all CSV discovery files
- Implement automated data refresh mechanisms
- Add data validation checkpoints

### PRIORITY 3: Enhanced Error Handling
- Add circuit breaker patterns for failing ViewModels
- Implement graceful degradation for UI components
- Add automatic retry with exponential backoff
