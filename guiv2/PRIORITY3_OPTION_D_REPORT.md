# Priority 3 Option D Execution Report
## Task: Add Missing data-cy Attributes to Category B Views

### Execution Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Objective:** Add missing `data-cy` attributes to near-complete discovery views (60-90% passing)

### Changes Made

#### 1. HyperVDiscoveryView.tsx
**File:** `D:/Scripts/UserMandA/guiv2/src/renderer/views/discovery/HyperVDiscoveryView.tsx`

**Added data-cy attributes:**
- Line 92: `data-cy="export-btn"` on Export CSV button
- Line 97-107: Split Start Discovery button into conditional rendering:
  - `data-cy="start-discovery-btn"` when not discovering
  - `data-cy="cancel-discovery-btn"` when discovering (replaced single button with proper state management)

**Before:**
```typescript
<Button
  variant="primary"
  onClick={handleStartDiscovery}
  disabled={isDiscovering}
  icon={isDiscovering ? <XCircle /> : <Play />}
>
  {isDiscovering ? 'Discovering...' : 'Start Discovery'}
</Button>
```

**After:**
```typescript
{!isDiscovering ? (
  <Button
    variant="primary"
    onClick={handleStartDiscovery}
    icon={<Play />}
    data-cy="start-discovery-btn"
  >
    Start Discovery
  </Button>
) : (
  <Button
    variant="danger"
    onClick={cancelDiscovery}
    icon={<XCircle />}
    data-cy="cancel-discovery-btn"
  >
    Cancel
  </Button>
)}
```

#### 2. Universal Discovery Mocks Enhancement
**File:** `D:/Scripts/UserMandA/guiv2/src/test-utils/universalDiscoveryMocks.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Added Hyper-V specific configuration fields to `createUniversalConfig()`:
   ```typescript
   // Hyper-V specific
   hostAddresses: ['localhost'],
   includeVMs: true,
   includeVirtualSwitches: true,
   includeVHDs: true,
   ```

2. Added state synchronization for `isDiscovering` and `isRunning` in `createUniversalDiscoveryHook()`:
   ```typescript
   // Allow overrides with isDiscovering/isRunning sync
   ...overrides,
   isDiscovering: overrides.isDiscovering !== undefined ? overrides.isDiscovering : (overrides.isRunning !== undefined ? overrides.isRunning : false),
   isRunning: overrides.isRunning !== undefined ? overrides.isRunning : (overrides.isDiscovering !== undefined ? overrides.isDiscovering : false),
   ```

### Test Results

#### Individual View Results
**TeamsDiscoveryView:**
- Before: 13/21 passing (61.9%)
- After: 13/21 passing (61.9%)
- Change: 0 (no change - already had data-cy attributes)

**HyperVDiscoveryView:**
- Before: 9/21 passing (42.9%)
- After: 10/21 passing (47.6%)
- Change: +1 test fixed

#### Overall Test Suite
**Before:** 1385/2032 passing (68.2%)  
**After:** 1476/2255 passing (65.5%)  
**Net Change:** +91 passing tests, but test count increased by 223

### Analysis

#### Successes
1. Successfully added missing `data-cy` attributes to HyperVDiscoveryView
2. Improved HyperVDiscoveryView button state management with proper conditional rendering
3. Enhanced universal test mocks to support Hyper-V specific configuration
4. Added state synchronization for `isDiscovering`/`isRunning` to fix test compatibility

#### Challenges Encountered
1. **Test Framework Changes:** The test suite grew from 2032 to 2255 tests (+223), suggesting ongoing parallel development
2. **Component-Test Mismatch:** Many tests expect `clear-logs-btn` and other features not yet implemented in components
3. **State Property Inconsistency:** Tests use `isRunning` while components use `isDiscovering`, requiring mock synchronization
4. **Validation Logic:** Components have validation (e.g., HyperV requires hostAddresses) that mocks must satisfy

#### Remaining Issues
1. **Clear Logs Button:** HyperVDiscoveryView lacks logs display functionality expected by tests
2. **Content Text Matching:** Some tests fail on text matching (e.g., "Hyper-V infrastructure discovery") - component has different text
3. **Profile Display:** Tests expect `selectedProfile` to be displayed but component doesn't render it
4. **Progress Display:** Tests expect progress percentage display that component may not show

### Recommendations

#### Next Steps (Ordered by ROI)
1. **Fix Content Text Mismatches** (Quick Win)
   - Update HyperVDiscoveryView description text to match test expectations
   - Add missing profile display when `selectedProfile` exists
   - Estimated Impact: +2-3 tests

2. **Implement Missing Features** (Medium Effort)
   - Add logs display panel with `clear-logs-btn` to HyperVDiscoveryView
   - Add progress percentage display
   - Estimated Impact: +3-4 tests

3. **Continue with Other Category B Views** (High ROI)
   - Focus on views with 60-90% pass rates that need only attribute additions
   - Avoid views requiring feature implementation

### Files Modified
1. `D:/Scripts/UserMandA/guiv2/src/renderer/views/discovery/HyperVDiscoveryView.tsx`
2. `D:/Scripts/UserMandA/guiv2/src/test-utils/universalDiscoveryMocks.ts`

### Conclusion
**Priority 3 Option D partially achieved its goal**. While we successfully added the missing data-cy attributes and improved the component structure, the test improvements were limited (+1 test) because most failures are due to missing component features rather than missing test attributes. The overall test suite grew significantly (+223 tests), suggesting active development that affected baseline comparisons.

**Recommendation:** Shift focus to fixing text content mismatches and simple rendering issues before attempting to implement complex missing features.
