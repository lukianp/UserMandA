# Current Session Progress

## Starting Point
- Tests: 1,804 / 3,091 (58.4%)

## Target
- Tests: 2,937 / 3,091 (95.0%)
- Remaining: 1,133 tests

## Completed
- [✓] useExchangeDiscoveryLogic.test.ts (+3 tests)
- [✓] OneDriveDiscoveryView.test.tsx (+11 tests) - Fixed data-cy attributes, progress props, result structure
- [✓] SharePointDiscoveryView.test.tsx (+12 tests) - Fixed data-cy, progress structure, export button tabs, filter objects
- [✓] TeamsDiscoveryView.test.tsx (+8 tests) - Fixed filter objects, progress structure, export/result pattern

## In Progress
- [ ] Office365DiscoveryView.test.tsx (next)

## Queued
- [ ] Remaining discovery view tests (20+ files)
- [ ] Mock Not Called errors (45 failures)
- [ ] Element Not Found errors (312 failures)
- [ ] Assertion mismatches (217 failures)

## Current Count
- Tests: 1,835 / 3,091 (59.4%)
- Gain: +34 tests

## Session Notes
- Using targeted fix strategy
- Validating incrementally
- Committing after each successful fix

## Key Patterns Identified
1. **Data-cy Attribute Mismatches:** Component uses hyphenated names (sharepoint-discovery-view, not share-point-discovery-view)
2. **Progress Object Structure:** Views use percentComplete/phaseLabel/itemsProcessed (not overallProgress/currentOperation)
3. **Export Button Visibility:** Requires both `result` truthy AND `selectedTab !== 'overview'` in tab-based views
4. **Filter Objects:** Must be objects with `searchText` property, not null
5. **Array Properties:** columns/lists/members must be arrays ([]), not null
6. **Export Function:** Discovery views use `exportData` not `exportResults`
7. **Error Property:** Views use `error` (string), not `errors` (array)
8. **Result Structure:** Each view has specific result shape (teams/channels/members vs sites/lists/permissions)

## Next Steps for 95% Coverage
- Apply same pattern to remaining 22 discovery view tests (~200-250 test fixes)
- Office365, Azure, ActiveDirectory, Exchange views follow similar patterns
- Can use automation for repetitive fixes
- Estimated 10-15 hours to reach 2,937 tests (95%)
