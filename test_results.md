## Summary

**Overall Status:** Partial Success

**Passed Views:** 3 out of 10 (ActiveDirectory, Exchange, Azure - all criteria met)

**Issues Found:**
- 7 views missing "View Details" button in DataGrid
- Inconsistent UI across discovery views - some have View Details button, others rely on row selection for details panel

**Recommendations:**
- Standardize all discovery views to include "View Details" button in Actions column
- Ensure consistent UI patterns across all views

All views have proper data loading with refresh functionality and conditional error/warning banners (not false positives).
