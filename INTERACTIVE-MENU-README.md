2. Review any warnings or errors immediately
3. Allow sufficient time for comprehensive discovery
4. Avoid interrupting long-running operations

### After Discovery
1. Review discovery summary and statistics
2. Check for any failed modules or errors
3. Validate critical data completeness
4. Archive results for future reference
