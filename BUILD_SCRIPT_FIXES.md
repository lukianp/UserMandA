# Build Script Fixes - PowerShell Strict Mode Issues

## Problem

The `buildguiv2.ps1` script was failing with PowerShell strict mode errors:

```
The property 'Statement' cannot be found on this object. Verify that the property exists.
```

This error occurred when trying to access pipeline variables and objects in strict mode.

## Root Cause

PowerShell's `Set-StrictMode -Version 3.0` enforces strict type checking and throws errors when:
1. Accessing properties that may not exist on objects
2. Using variables that might not be initialized
3. Performing operations on potentially null values

The script had three locations where this caused issues:

### Issue 1: npm Check (Lines 99-131)
```powershell
$npmCmd = Get-Command npm -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# Later trying to execute $npmCmd which could be CommandInfo or string path
# caused strict mode violation
```

### Issue 2: TypeScript Compilation Check (Lines 187-195)
```powershell
& npx tsc --noEmit  # Output might be empty or contain objects without expected properties
```

###Issue 3: Build Output Piping (Lines 207-230)
```powershell
& npm run package 2>&1 | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_ -match "error|failed") {  # $_ might have Statement property in strict mode
        Write-Host "  $_" -ForegroundColor Red
    }
}
```

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: npm Check
**Before:**
```powershell
$npmCmd = Get-Command npm -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if ($npmCmd) {
    $npmVersion = & $npmCmd --version 2>$null
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "  [OK] Found npm version: $npmVersion" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
}
```

**After:**
```powershell
try {
    $npmVersion = & npm --version 2>&1
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "  [OK] Found npm version: $npmVersion" -ForegroundColor Green
    } else {
        throw "npm command failed with exit code $LASTEXITCODE"
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Warning "npm check failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    Write-Host "  [INFO] Attempting to use npm anyway..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
}
```

### Fix 2: TypeScript Check
**Before:**
```powershell
& npx tsc --noEmit
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    Write-Warning "TypeScript compilation has errors. Continuing anyway..."
}
```

**After:**
```powershell
try {
    $tscOutput = & npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
        Write-Warning "TypeScript compilation has errors. Continuing anyway..."
        Write-Host "  [WARNING] TypeScript errors detected (non-blocking)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    } else {
        Write-Host "  [OK] TypeScript compilation successful" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Warning "TypeScript check failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    Write-Host "  [WARNING] TypeScript check skipped" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}
```

### Fix 3: Build Output
**Before:**
```powershell
& npm run package 2>&1 | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_ -match "error|failed") {
        Write-Host "  $_" -ForegroundColor Red
    } elseif ($_ -match "warning") {
        Write-Host "  $_" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    } else {
        Write-Host "  $_" -ForegroundColor Gray
    }
}
```

**After:**
```powershell
try {
    $buildOutput = & npm run package 2>&1
    $buildOutput | Out-Host
}
catch {
    Write-Warning "Build command failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Strict Mode Compliance**: Script now works correctly with `Set-StrictMode -Version 3.0`
2. **Better Error Handling**: Wrapped all external command executions in try-catch blocks
3. **Cleaner Output**: Direct output instead of complex ForEach-Object pipeline filtering
4. **More Reliable**: Explicit error checking and reporting

## Testing

The script should now run without strict mode errors:

```powershell
# Test the fixed script
.\buildguiv2.ps1 -Configuration Development -SkipTests
```

Expected output:
- ✅ No "Property 'Statement' cannot be found" errors
- ✅ npm version check passes
- ✅ TypeScript compilation check completes
- ✅ Build proceeds without strict mode violations

## Additional Notes

### Why ForEach-Object Failed

In strict mode, when piping output from external commands to `ForEach-Object`, PowerShell may wrap the output in objects with metadata properties like `Statement`. Accessing `$_` directly can trigger strict mode violations because:

1. The pipeline object might have properties that strict mode considers invalid to access
2. The `$_` automatic variable's type can vary based on the pipeline input
3. Pattern matching operations on `$_` can fail if the object structure is unexpected

The solution is to:
1. Capture the output in a variable first
2. Use `Out-Host` for direct output instead of filtering
3. Or explicitly cast `$_` to `[string]` when needed

### Alternative Approach (If Output Filtering Needed)

If you need to filter output by error/warning levels, use:

```powershell
$buildOutput = & npm run package 2>&1
$buildOutput | ForEach-Object {
    $line = [string]$_
    if ($line -match "error|failed") {
        Write-Host "  $line" -ForegroundColor Red
    } elseif ($line -match "warning") {
        Write-Host "  $line" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    } else {
        Write-Host "  $line" -ForegroundColor Gray
    }
}
```

The key difference is explicitly casting `$_` to `[string]` before any operations.
