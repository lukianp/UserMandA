# DatabaseSchemaDiscovery Complete Method Fix

## Issue Description
The DatabaseSchemaDiscovery module was failing with the error:
```
Method invocation failed because [System.Collections.Hashtable] does not contain a method named 'Complete'.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the hashtable-based result object initialization. The code attempted to create a "pseudo-method" using scriptblocks with `$this` reference:

```powershell
$result = @{
    # ... other properties
    Complete = { $this.EndTime = Get-Date }.GetNewClosure()
}
```

In PowerShell, `$this` in scriptblocks defined within hashtable literals does not refer to the hashtable itself. This causes the scriptblock to be invalid when called.

## Solution
The fix involved removing the problematic `Complete` method from the hashtable and directly setting the `EndTime` property in the `finally` block:

### Before (Broken):
```powershell
$result = @{
    # ... properties
    Complete = { $this.EndTime = Get-Date }.GetNewClosure()
}
# ...
finally {
    $stopwatch.Stop()
    $result.Complete()  # This fails
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```powershell
$result = @{
    # ... properties
    # No Complete method added
}
# ...
finally {
    $stopwatch.Stop()
    $result.EndTime = Get-Date  # Direct assignment
}
```

## Impact
This fix resolves the specific error in DatabaseSchemaDiscovery, but the same pattern exists in **over 50 other modules** across the M&A Discovery Suite codebase. Any of these modules could potentially encounter the same error.

## Affected Modules (Partial List)
- All discovery modules (PhysicalServerDiscovery, DataClassificationDiscovery, etc.)
- Utility modules (CSVMergeUtility, ComprehensiveErrorHandling)
- Integration modules (CMDBIntegration)
- Assessment modules (EnvironmentRiskScoring)

## Verification
After applying the fix, the module was tested and completed successfully:

```
Testing DatabaseSchemaDiscovery fix...
[2025-09-02 22:22:44] [HEADER] [Database] Starting Database Schema Discovery (v1.0)
# ... discovery steps
[2025-09-02 22:22:44] [HEADER] [Database] Database schema discovery finished in 00:00:00. Records: 0.
SUCCESS: Database discovery completed successfully!
EndTime: 09/02/2025 22:22:44
Success: True
```

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate Fix**: Apply this same pattern to all affected modules by removing the faulty `Complete` method definitions and replacing `$result.Complete()` calls with direct property assignments.
2. **Preventive Measure**: Consider refactoring the hashtable-based result pattern to use proper PowerShell objects (PSCustomObject) that can contain proper methods.
3. **Testing**: Test all discovery modules individually to ensure they complete without errors.

## Files Modified
- `Modules/Discovery/DatabaseSchemaDiscovery.psm1` - Applied the fix
- `Scripts/test-database-discovery-fix.ps1` - Created test script to verify the fix

## Next Steps
Apply the same fix to all other modules identified in the search results. The pattern is consistent across all affected modules, so the same changes should resolve the issue everywhere.
