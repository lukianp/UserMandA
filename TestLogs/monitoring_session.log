2025-08-20 - POST-FIX TESTING SESSION INITIATED

PRIORITY MONITORING AREAS:
1. Users View Performance - UsersViewModelNew load times and freeze indicators
2. Groups View Functionality - GroupsViewModelNew loading and "not implemented" error elimination
3. Navigation Smoothness - view switching performance across all menu items
4. Red Banner Reduction - converter errors and missing column warnings
5. Overall Application Health - memory usage, CPU performance, and crash monitoring

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS TO TRACK:
- Users view should load without freezing (previous issue)
- Groups view should load data instead of showing "not implemented" error
- Converter-related red banners should be eliminated
- Navigation should be consistently smooth and responsive

CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS:
- Users view load time: Target <2 seconds (previously froze)
- Groups view functionality: Should show data rows (previously failed)
- Navigation responsiveness: All menu items should work smoothly
- Error count: Should remain at 0 with improved warning counts

SESSION STATUS: ACTIVE - Awaiting user testing feedback
