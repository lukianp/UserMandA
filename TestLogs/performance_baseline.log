POST-FIX TESTING SESSION - PERFORMANCE BASELINE
==================================================
Session Start: 2025-08-20
Focus: Users View freeze fix, Groups View "not implemented" fix

CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS REVIEW:
From structured_log_20250820.log analysis:

DASHBOARD PERFORMANCE:
- DiscoveryDashboardViewModel loading correctly
- Load times: 200-300ms (healthy baseline)
- KPI data loading: users=303, groups=210, computers=258, applications=33, policies=15
- Warning count escalation: 4 -> 8 -> 13 (need to monitor this pattern)

VIEWMODEL INITIALIZATION STATUS:
- BreadcrumbNavigationViewModel: INITIALIZED ✓
- DiscoveryDashboardViewModel: INITIALIZED ✓  
- InfrastructureViewModelNew: INITIALIZED ✓
- DatabasesViewModelNew: INITIALIZED ✓

NOTABLE PATTERNS:
- Multiple dashboard load events (lines 7-16, 25-34, 46-50)
- Warning count increases during multi-load sequences
- All core services starting properly

CRITICAL MONITORING POINTS FOR TESTING:
1. UsersViewModelNew initialization (not seen in recent logs - key test area)
2. GroupsViewModelNew initialization (not seen in recent logs - key test area)
3. Load time performance vs baseline
4. Warning count stability
5. View transition smoothness

EXPECTED POST-FIX BEHAVIORS:
- UsersViewModelNew should initialize without freezing
- GroupsViewModelNew should load data instead of showing "not implemented"
- Navigation should remain responsive across all views
- Error/warning counts should remain stable or decrease

MONITORING STATUS: ACTIVE - Ready for user testing session
