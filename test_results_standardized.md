## Summary
âœ… **All six standardized discovery views pass validation**

- **Data Loading**: All views correctly load data from CSV sources and calculate accurate summary statistics
- **Summary Cards**: All views display 4 summary cards with accurate metrics and proper formatting
- **DataGrid Functionality**: All views have functional DataGrids with appropriate columns and row interactions
- **Detail Panels**: All views provide detail functionality (either inline panels or tab navigation)
- **Responsive Layout**: All views implement responsive designs with GridSplitter controls where appropriate

## Architecture Compliance
The views follow the standardized BaseDiscoveryViewTemplate architecture with:
- Consistent header sections with warnings/error banners
- UniformGrid for 4 summary statistic cards
- ToolBar for action buttons
- Grid layout with DataGrid and details panel separated by GridSplitter
- Footer sections for additional information

## Performance Notes
- All views implement async loading with proper loading states
- Detail panels use async loading where complex data processing is required
- Responsive behavior includes panel collapse on narrow screens where applicable
