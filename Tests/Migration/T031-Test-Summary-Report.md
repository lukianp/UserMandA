### Artifacts

#### **report_paths**
- `Run-PreMigrationTests.ps1` - Comprehensive test runner with HTML/JSON/TXT reporting
- `Validate-T031-Implementation.ps1` - Implementation validation script
- JSON test results output for automated processing
- HTML reports for human-readable results
- TXT summary reports for logging systems

### Functional Cases (Detailed Results)

1. **Large Dataset Performance Test**
   - 10,000 users, 8,000 mailboxes, 5,000 file shares, 500 databases
   - Processing completed within 5-minute time limit
   - Memory usage remained stable throughout processing
   - All eligibility rules applied correctly at scale

2. **Enterprise Mixed Scenario**
   - 70% eligible, 30% blocked ratio (realistic enterprise distribution)
   - Multiple blocking reasons correctly identified and categorized
   - Manual mapping overrides fuzzy matching as expected
   - Business rules prevent blocked items from proceeding to migration

3. **Fuzzy Matching Real-World Names**
   - "Michael Johnson" → "Mike Johnson": High similarity match
   - "Katherine Smith" → "Kate Smith": Medium similarity match  
   - "Robert Williams" → "Bob Williams": Acceptable similarity match
   - Jaro-Winkler algorithm performs within expected parameters

4. **Cross-Session Mapping Persistence**
   - Manual mappings saved to JSON format successfully
   - Mappings restored correctly after service restart
   - Manual overrides maintained across sessions
   - Data integrity preserved through serialization/deserialization

5. **Thread Safety Validation**
   - Concurrent eligibility checks executed without data corruption
   - Multiple mapping persistence operations completed successfully
   - No race conditions detected during high-concurrency testing

6. **Error Handling Robustness**
   - Invalid Unicode characters handled gracefully
   - Corrupted JSON mapping files processed without crashes
   - Missing CSV files detected with appropriate error messages
   - Edge cases (null values, empty strings) managed correctly
