ROOT CAUSE
----------
The application is exiting immediately because:1. XAML resource files are missing. The application cannot initialize its UI
   without these theme and style files. This causes an immediate crash when
   App.xaml tries to load the missing ResourceDictionaries.

   Solution: Run Build-GUI.ps1 to copy all resources to the build directory.2. The main window XAML file is missing. The StartupUri in App.xaml points
   to 'MandADiscoverySuite.xaml' which cannot be found.

   Solution: Ensure the build process includes all XAML files.
