MISSING RESOURCES
-----------------
- Main window XAML file missing (MandADiscoverySuite.xaml)
- Resources folder missing
- Views folder missing
- Missing: Resources\Converters.xaml
- Missing: Resources\DataGridTheme.xaml
- Missing: Resources\ButtonStyles.xaml
- Missing: Resources\DiscoveryViewStyles.xaml

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
-------------------The application exits immediately because the main window XAML file is missing.
The StartupUri in App.xaml points to 'MandADiscoverySuite.xaml' which cannot be found.

Solution: Run Build-GUI.ps1 to properly build and copy all XAML files.
RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------1. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
   - Run Build-GUI.ps1 to rebuild the application with all resources
   - Ensure all XAML files are included in the build output
   - Verify the Resources and Views folders are copied to the build directory
