# M&A Discovery Suite - Session Log
Date: 2025-07-28
Session Start: 14:39 UTC

## Current Status Overview

### 1. QuickStart.ps1 Enhancements (v7.0.0) - COMPLETED
- **Version**: Upgraded from 6.0.0 to 7.0.0
- **Status**: Modified but not committed
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added Interactive mode as default mode
  - Integrated Azure AD app registration prompt
  - Added new parameters: SecretValidityYears, SkipAzureRoles
  - Fixed interactive mode handling to avoid redundant menu launches
  - Added proper fallback when interactive menu is not found

### 2. DiscoveryCreateAppRegistration.ps1 Fixes - COMPLETED
- **Issues Found**:
  - Color parameter splatting syntax errors (FIXED)
  - Multiline comment terminator missing (FIXED)
  - Windows-specific code incompatible with Linux (PARTIALLY FIXED)
  
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Fixed color splatting: First changed `@($script:ColorScheme.*)` to `@script:ColorScheme.*`, then properly fixed by extracting to variables
  - Fixed multiline comment terminator from `#` to `#>`
  - Made administrator check cross-platform compatible
  - Made file permissions handling cross-platform
  - Added cross-platform credential storage (plain JSON on Linux, DPAPI on Windows)
  - Added AutoInstallModules parameter with proper default behavior
  - Fixed AutoInstallModules to default to true unless explicitly set to false

### 3. Git Status

```

### 4. Testing Results
- QuickStart.ps1 runs successfully in non-interactive modes on Linux
- Interactive Menu fails on Linux due to Windows Principal calls
- Orchestrator loads and validates correctly
- Profile creation for 'ljops' successful

## Remaining Issues

### High Priority
1. **Interactive-Menu.ps1** - Still has Windows-specific authentication code
2. **App Registration Script** - Needs full testing on Windows for Azure AD functionality
3. **Logging System** - Write-MandALog has file write errors (parameter issue)

### Medium Priority
1. Test full app registration flow on Windows
2. Verify module auto-installation works correctly
3. Test credential encryption/decryption on both platforms

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Cross-platform Support**: Made scripts detect platform and use appropriate methods
2. **Credential Storage**: 
   - Windows: DPAPI encryption
   - Linux: Plain JSON with 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
3. **Module Installation**: Automatic by default, can be disabled with -AutoInstallModules:$false

## Next Steps
1. Fix Interactive-Menu.ps1 for cross-platform compatibility
2. Test full workflow on Windows system
3. Commit changes once verified
4. Document platform-specific behaviors

## Important Notes
- The suite is designed primarily for Windows environments
- Linux support is limited but functional for testing
- Azure AD operations require Windows for full functionality
- All authentication features need Windows environment
