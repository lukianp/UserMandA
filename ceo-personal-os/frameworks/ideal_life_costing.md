# Ideal Life Costing (Inspired by Tim Ferriss)

Tim Ferriss's "Ideal Lifestyle Costing" from "The 4-Hour Workweek" is simple yet powerful: Calculate the exact annual cost to live your dream life, then build income streams to match – no more, no less. It's about financial freedom on your terms.

For CEOs, this prevents the trap of equating success with endless accumulation. It ensures your wealth serves your Vivid Vision, not vice versa.

## Core Idea

Most people work harder for more money without defining "enough." Ferriss asks: What does your ideal life actually cost? Then optimize to fund it efficiently.

## How to Do Ideal Life Costing

Spend 30-60 minutes. Be specific: research real costs for housing, travel, etc. Include "invisible" costs like health insurance or childcare.

Update annually as your vision evolves.

## Next Steps: Funding Your Ideal Life

- **Current Income Gap**: How does this compare to your current earnings? What's the gap?
- **Income Optimization**: How to close it? Diversify streams (business, investments, passive income).
- **Leverage Analysis**: What high-leverage actions (e.g., product launches, investments) could fund this without 80-hour weeks?
- **Minimum Viable Income**: What's the minimum to maintain this lifestyle comfortably?

## Integration

Use this in annual reviews to assess financial alignment. Adjust as your vision changes. If costs feel too high, refine your ideal life to be more achievable.
