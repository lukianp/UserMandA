# Annual Review Framework (Inspired by Dr. Anthony Gustin)

Dr. Anthony Gustin, a productivity expert, designed an annual review that goes beyond surface-level reflection. It's a deep dive into the year: what worked, what didn't, and how to carry those lessons forward. Adapted for CEOs, this framework helps you review performance, extract insights, and plan strategically – without the fluff.

The review takes 2-4 hours and is done once a year. It ties into your Life Map, Ideal Life Costing, and Vivid Vision for a holistic view.

## Key Elements

- **Honest Assessment**: Acknowledge wins and misses with candor.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes from your past (use insights from memory.md).
- **Future-Focused**: Turn lessons into actionable plans.
- **Balance Check**: Ensure career isn't overshadowing health or relationships.

## When to Use

End of year, before setting new goals. Use as the foundation for your annual review template in `reviews/annual/annual_review_template.md`.

## Template Structure

### 1. Year in Review: Highlights First

- What were the top 3-5 highlights of the year? (Professional, personal, unexpected wins)
- What were the lowlights or disappointments? (Be specific, no sugarcoating)
- Overall, on a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the year? Why?

### 2. Lessons Learned

- What did you learn about yourself? (Strengths, blind spots, triggers)
- What patterns emerged? (Repeated successes, failures, themes from past reviews in memory.md)
- What surprised you? (Assumptions challenged)

### 3. What to Continue, Start, or Stop

- What habits or actions should you continue? (Energy-boosting routines, high-leverage decisions)
- What should you stop? (Time drains, unproductive meetings, bad habits)
- What new practices should you start? (Based on lessons)

### 4. Energy and Leverage Analysis

- Where did you expend the most energy? Was it high-leverage?
- How did your energy levels fluctuate? What drained or fueled you?
- Leverage question: What 20% of efforts produced 80% of results? Focus more there.

### 5. Relationships and Impact

- How did relationships evolve? (Team, family, network)
- What impact did you have on others? (Positive and negative)
- Personal board check: What would your "board of directors" advise?

### 6. Financial and Life Costing Snapshot

- How did finances align with your Ideal Life Costing? Adjustments needed?
- What "costs" (time, stress) did you incur for professional gains? Worth it?

### 7. Future Intent: The Next Year

- Based on this review, what's your intent for the next year? (Key themes, not detailed goals)
- How will you update your Life Map and North Star?
- One big risk or experiment to try?

### 8. Regret Minimization

- If this year repeated 10 times, would you be satisfied?
- What would you regret not doing? How to address in the next year?

This framework ensures your annual review is thorough yet practical. Use it to inform your 1-year goals and quarterly reviews. Credit to Dr. Gustin for the original structure; adapted here for executive clarity.
