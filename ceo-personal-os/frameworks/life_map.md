# Life Map (Inspired by Alex Lieberman)

Alex Lieberman of Morning Brew created the Life Map as a simple tool to maintain balance across six areas of life. It's not about perfection; it's about awareness and intentionality.

CEOs are prone to excelling in career while neglecting health or relationships. The Life Map provides a quarterly snapshot to course-correct.

## The Six Areas

1. **Career**: Your professional path, impact, and growth. Includes leadership, achievements, and work satisfaction.
2. **Relationships**: Connections with family, friends, partners, and community. Quality over quantity.
3. **Health**: Physical fitness, mental health, energy levels. How you care for your body and mind.
4. **Meaning**: Sense of purpose, contribution, and legacy. What makes your life matter.
5. **Finances**: Money management, savings, investments, and financial freedom. Peace of mind around wealth.
6. **Fun**: Leisure, hobbies, play, and joy. Recharging activities that bring happiness.

These areas are interdependent – imbalance in one affects others.

## How to Map Your Life

Do this quarterly (end of Q1, Q2, etc.) or as part of annual reviews. Takes 15-30 minutes.

Rate each area 1-10 (1 = neglected, 10 = thriving). Add notes on wins, challenges, and 1-2 actions to improve.

Aim for balance: No area below 6/10 long-term.

## Overall Reflection
- Which areas are strongest? Weakest?
- How does career impact others (e.g., health suffers from overwork)?
- What one change could improve balance?

## Integration
Use this in quarterly reviews to guide adjustments. Update annually in the full annual review. Reference in memory.md for patterns over time.
