# Principles

These core principles underpin every part of your personal operating system. They ensure the system serves you without becoming a burden.

## Clarity Over Complexity

Simplicity is power. We use plain text files and straightforward prompts because you don't need more tools. Everything is editable, searchable, and portable.

## Reflection Over Reaction

In a fast-paced CEO life, it's easy to react. This system builds in regular pauses for reflection – daily, weekly, quarterly, annually – so you lead from insight, not impulse.

## Long-Term Focus

CEOs think in horizons. Your North Star guides 10-year vision, while 1- and 3-year goals bridge the gap. Short-term tactics serve long-term strategy.

## Personalization

No one-size-fits-all. Customize placeholders like [YOUR ROLE] or [YOUR STAGE OF LIFE] to make the system yours. Skip or modify frameworks that don't fit your context.

## Psychological Safety

Reflection should feel supportive, not judgmental. Questions are designed to explore without criticism. This creates space for honest self-assessment and growth.

## Low Maintenance

Your time is scarce. Daily check-ins take 5 minutes. Weekly reviews add 10-15. Quarterly and annual deeper dives are scheduled, not constant. The system integrates seamlessly.

## Leverage and Effort

CEO effectiveness comes from high-leverage actions – decisions that compound. Analyze where your effort creates the most impact, and where it's wasted. Focus energy there.

## Energy Management

Your energy, not just time, is finite. Track it daily, manage it quarterly. As a leader, sustaining high performance means protecting and directing your personal fuel.

## Board of Directors Mentality

Imagine a personal board of directors – wise versions of yourself, mentors, or advisors. Consult them mentally for big decisions. This adds perspective without external dependencies.

## Regret Minimization

When setting goals or making choices, ask: What will I regret not pursuing? This frames decisions around a full life, not just professional success.

These principles are your foundation. Revisit them if the system feels off. They're here to keep you clear, focused, and in control.
