# CEO Personal Operating System

This is your private personal productivity system. It's not a SaaS tool, not a startup idea, and not a dashboard. It's a simple collection of markdown files designed for a busy CEO like you – someone who wants more clarity without more bureaucracy.

The system helps you reflect deeply, define meaningful goals, run quick check-ins, review past performance, design your ideal future, and maintain focus – all using plain text and conversational prompts. It's built for non-technical users who prefer thinking over tooling.

## Core Principles (Read First)

Open `principles.md` to understand the mindset behind this system. It takes 2 minutes and sets the tone for everything else.

## Quick Start (Under 15 Minutes)

1. **Set Your North Star**: Open `north_star.md` and fill in your long-term vision. Replace placeholders like [YOUR COMPANY], [YOUR ROLE], [YOUR STAGE OF LIFE], and [YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES] with your reality.

2. **Personalize Placeholders**: Search for and replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., [YOUR NAME]) across the files to make the system feel like yours.

3. **Initial Interviews**: If you're new, start with the interviews in the `interviews/` folder. They help you clarify your identity, values, and future self. These are optional but recommended for grounding.

4. **Goal Setting**: Open `goals/1_year.md`, `goals/3_year.md`, and `goals/10_year.md`. Define your horizons. Keep them realistic and tied to your north star.

That's it. You're ready to begin using the system immediately.

## Daily Rhythm (5 Minutes)

End each day with clarity, not overwhelm.

- Open `reviews/daily/daily_checkin_template.md`.
- Copy its contents into a new file named with today's date (e.g., `2025-01-01.md`) inside `reviews/daily/`.
- Answer the four prompts honestly. Be brief – this takes under 5 minutes.
- Do this consistently to build momentum and catch friction early.

## Weekly Rhythm (10-15 Minutes)

Pause each Friday to assess the week.

- Open `reviews/weekly/weekly_review_template.md`.
- Create a new file for the week (e.g., `Week_of_2025-01-01.md`) in `reviews/weekly/`.
- Reflect on what moved the needle, what was noise, time leaks, one insight, and one adjustment.
- This keeps you strategic without micromanaging.

## Quarterly Rhythm (30-60 Minutes)

Every three months, take stock.

- Open `reviews/quarterly/quarterly_review_template.md`.
- Create a dated file in `reviews/quarterly/`.
- Evaluate goal progress, analyze energy output, detect misalignments, and adjust course.
- Use this to pivot thoughtfully, not reactively.

## Annual Rhythm (2-4 Hours)

Once a year, go deep.

- Upload any past annual reviews, performance docs, or notes to `uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `uploads/notes/`.
- Run the annual review template from `reviews/annual/annual_review_template.md` in a new file.
- Synthesize patterns using the frameworks in `frameworks/` (e.g., Life Map, Ideal Life Costing).
- Update your goals and north star.
- Store key insights in `memory.md` for future reference.

## Uploading and Pattern Synthesis

To extract patterns from your past:

- Place documents in `uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `uploads/notes/`.
- Open `memory.md` and summarize recurring themes, strengths, blind spots, and lessons from those documents.
- Reference these in future reviews to avoid repeating mistakes and build on successes.

## Frameworks

The system draws on proven frameworks, adapted for CEOs:

- **Annual Review** (inspired by Dr. Anthony Gustin): A structured way to reflect on the year, update your life map, and plan ahead.
- **Vivid Vision** (Tony Robbins-style): Paint a detailed picture of your ideal future to stay motivated.
- **Ideal Life Costing** (Tim Ferriss): Calculate the true cost of your dream life to make informed decisions.
- **Life Map** (Alex Lieberman): Map your career, relationships, health, meaning, finances, and fun for balance.

Plus additional tools like CEO energy management, a personal board of directors, regret minimization, and leverage analysis.

Explore them in the `frameworks/` folder when relevant.

## Customization

This system is yours to adapt. If a framework doesn't fit, skip it. If you need more detail, add it. The goal is clarity, not perfection.

## Support

No tech support needed – it's all plain text. If you want to extend it, just copy and modify the templates.

Remember: This is about steady progress, not hustle. Use it to gain perspective, not create pressure.
