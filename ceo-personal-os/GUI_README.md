# CEO Personal OS GUI

This graphical user interface makes it easy to navigate, read, and edit your personal productivity system without touching code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended).

### Launch the GUI
1. Navigate to the `ceo-personal-os` folder.
2. Double-click `run-gui.bat`.
   - On first run, it installs dependencies (may take 1-2 minutes).
   - The server starts on `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Using the GUI
- **Navigation**: Use the sidebar to browse sections.
- **Viewing Files**: Click on any `.md` file to display it.
- **Editing**: Click "Edit" to switch to edit mode, make changes, then "Save".
- **Reviews**: Click on review folders (Daily, Weekly, etc.) to list files. Use "Create New Review" to start a new entry from the template.
- **Uploads**: In the Uploads section, use forms to upload past documents to `past_annual_reviews` or `notes` folders.
- **Memory**: Load and edit your insights database.

The interface is designed for simplicity and speed, aligning with the system's principles.

If you encounter issues, ensure Node.js is installed and no other service uses port 3000.
