# Future Self Interview

In this exercise, imagine stepping into the shoes of your future self – the you from 10 years ahead, living your North Star. Ask them questions, and "hear" their responses. This builds foresight and prevents short-term decisions that derail long-term goals.

Do this annually or when facing big choices. Write as if they're speaking to you.
