# Past Year Reflection Interview

This interview is a calm, private conversation with yourself about the year that was. It's not a performance review; it's a chance to reflect deeply and extract wisdom. Take 30-60 minutes in a quiet space. Write your answers freely – no editing, no judgment.

Use this at year-end or when you need perspective. Insights can feed into your annual review or memory.md.

## Guided Questions

   *Your reflections:*

3. **Where did you avoid hard decisions?** What conversations, changes, or actions did you put off? Why? What was the cost?

   *Your reflections:*

4. **What are you proud of that no one else sees?** The quiet wins, internal growth, or behind-the-scenes efforts that matter to you.

   *Your reflections:*

5. **What would you not repeat under any circumstances?** Decisions, habits, or situations you'd erase if you could.

   *Your reflections:*

6. **If this year repeated ten times, would you be satisfied?** Looking ahead, does this path lead to the life you want? What needs to change?

   *Your reflections:*
