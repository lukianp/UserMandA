# Weekly Review Template

Do this every Friday afternoon. Copy into a new file named `Week_of_[start_date].md` in `reviews/weekly/`. Takes 10-15 minutes. Keeps you strategic, not reactive.

**Week of:** [e.g., 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-05]

**What moved the needle this week?** [The 1-2 accomplishments or decisions that advanced your long-term goals. Be specific.]

**What was noise?** [Meetings, tasks, or interruptions that felt like busywork. What could you minimize?]

**Where did time leak?** [Areas where hours slipped away (e.g., emails, social media). Quantify if possible.]

**One strategic insight:** [Key lesson from the week. What pattern or truth emerged?]

**One adjustment for next week:** [One change to implement. Could be a boundary, delegation, or focus shift.]

*Optional: Energy notes* [How did your energy hold up? Any patterns from daily check-ins?]

*Goals alignment:* [How did this week serve your 1-year or 3-year goals?]

This review prevents weekly drift. Use insights to adjust priorities before Monday.
