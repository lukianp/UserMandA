# 10-Year Goals

These are your legacy horizons, the big bets that define your life's impact. Set 1-2 overarching goals. They should feel audacious and tied to your North Star. Revisit annually but change rarely.

**Years:** [e.g., 2025-2035]

**Context:** From [YOUR STAGE OF LIFE] to [future stage], evolving [YOUR COMPANY] into [vision].

## Goal 1: [e.g., Build [YOUR COMPANY] into a industry leader with global impact]
- **Why:** [Legacy in business, solving [problem]]
- **How to Measure:** [Market share, lives improved, financial outcomes]
- **Themes:** [Innovation, team development, sustainability]

## Goal 2: [e.g., Create a balanced, fulfilling life of meaning]
- **Why:** [Holistic fulfillment, not just career]
- **How to Measure:** [Life Map balance, personal contributions]
- **Themes:** [Health, relationships, giving back]

**Regret Minimization Check:** Would you regret not pursuing these?

**Integration:** These inspire 3-year goals and daily decisions. Update only if your North Star shifts dramatically.
