# North Star

Your North Star is the long-term vision that guides all decisions. It's not a goal to achieve but a direction to orient toward. Define it clearly, then let it steer you.

## Your Current Context

You are [YOUR ROLE] at [YOUR COMPANY], navigating [YOUR STAGE OF LIFE], with these top priorities right now: [YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES].

This context grounds your vision in reality.

## 10-Year Vision (Vivid Vision Framework)

Imagine it's 10 years from now. You've built the life you want. Describe it in detail, as if you're living it today. Use the Life Map categories for balance:

- **Career**: What are you leading or building? What mark have you left on [YOUR INDUSTRY] or the world? How has your role evolved from [YOUR CURRENT ROLE]?

- **Relationships**: Who is in your inner circle? How do you spend time with family, friends, and community? What kind of partner or parent are you?

- **Health**: How does your body and mind feel? What routines support your energy? How do you manage stress as a CEO?

- **Finances**: What level of freedom do you have? Are you funding causes you care about? What's your relationship with money?

- **Meaning**: What purpose drives you? How are you contributing beyond [YOUR COMPANY]? What legacy matters?

- **Fun**: What brings joy and play? Travel, hobbies, downtime – how do you recharge and celebrate?

Be specific. If it's a quiet evening with family, describe it. If it's leading a global team, paint the scene. This vivid picture motivates and clarifies.

## Regret Minimization Check

Looking back from this future, what would you regret not doing now? Ensure your vision includes those elements.

## Updating Your North Star

Revisit this annually in your annual review. Life changes – update accordingly. It's a living document, not etched in stone.

This North Star will anchor your 1-, 3-, and 10-year goals. Use it to evaluate opportunities: Does this move me toward my vision? If not, politely decline.
