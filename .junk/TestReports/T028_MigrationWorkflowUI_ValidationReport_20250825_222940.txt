KEY FINDINGS:
-------------

CRITICAL INTEGRATIONS VERIFIED:
  + Constructor T-027 Integration: Integration verified
  + Event Subscription Init: Integration verified
  + Progress Event Handler: Integration verified
  + Completed Event Handler: Integration verified
  + Error Event Handler: Integration verified
  + Event Subscription: Integration verified
  + Event Unsubscription: Integration verified
  + T-027 Engine Events: Integration verified
  + T-027 Event Arguments: Integration verified
  + T-027 Wave Execution: Integration verified
  + T-027 Provider Adapters: Integration verified

CRITICAL INTEGRATION FAILURES:
  - Migration Engine Resolver: ResolveOrCreateMigrationEngine method not found
  - Wave Creation Method: CreateMigrationWaveFromExecutionItems method not found
  - T-027 Wave Execution Method: ExecuteMigrationWaveAsync method not found in T-027

IMPORTANT WARNINGS:
  ! Pre-flight Validation: Pre-flight validation check should be implemented
  ! Migration Execution Error Handling: Error handling pattern should be verified

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
[TODO] Address critical integration failures before deployment
[TODO] Complete missing T-027 engine integration points
[TODO] Implement comprehensive error handling patterns

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Review and fix any critical failures identified above
2. Implement runtime testing with mock migration scenarios
3. Test real-time event handling with UI responsiveness
4. Validate cancellation and rollback mechanisms
5. Perform end-to-end integration testing with T-027 engine
