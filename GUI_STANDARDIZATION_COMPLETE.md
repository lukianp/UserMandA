# GUI Standardization Complete

## Summary of Changes

This standardization effort focused on unifying the graphical user interface (GUI) components across the M&A Discovery application to ensure a consistent user experience. Key changes include:

- Implemented RoundedButtonStyle as the standard button style across all views
- Established a standard view template with consistent layout, spacing, and theming
- Updated all discovery and detail views to use the standardized components
- Ensured responsive design principles are applied uniformly
- Integrated consistent error handling and loading states

## List of Updated Views

The following views were updated as part of the standardization:

- MicrosoftTeamsDiscoveryView.xaml
- SharePointDiscoveryView.xaml
- UserDetailView.xaml
- VMMigrationView.xaml
- VMwareDiscoveryView.xaml
- WhatIfSimulationView.xaml
- NetworkInfrastructureDiscoveryView.xaml
- OneDriveBusinessDiscoveryView.xaml
- AzureDiscoveryView.xaml
- AzureInfrastructureDiscoveryView.xaml
- ComputerDetailView.xaml
- ComputersView.xaml
- ConditionalAccessPoliciesDiscoveryView.xaml
- AssetDetailView (ViewModel updated)

## Known Limitations

- Some legacy components may still reference deprecated styles during transition period
- Performance impact on very large datasets due to unified rendering pipeline
- Accessibility features are partially implemented and require further refinement
- Theming support is limited to light and dark modes only

## Future Enhancements

- Implement full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Add support for custom themes and user-defined color schemes
- Optimize rendering performance for large-scale data visualization
- Integrate advanced animation and transition effects
- Expand responsive design for tablet and mobile interfaces

## Conclusion

The GUI standardization effort has successfully established a cohesive user interface framework that improves usability, maintainability, and scalability of the M&A Discovery application. By adopting the RoundedButtonStyle and standard view template, the application now provides a more professional and consistent user experience across all modules. This foundation will support future enhancements and ensure easier maintenance as the application evolves.
